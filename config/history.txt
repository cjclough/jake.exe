i don't really care anymore
he's making this way too complicated
no
but it would be easy to use
he just doesn't like it
and he insists on using json data instead of normal post and get requests
he's trying to apply best practices to something that's so barebones
he was gonna use fucking ELM before we teamed up
html and javascript
let me know when you're on your way
we should probably go to tech hall
i can't find a room
okay cool, i'm gonna head over there in a bit
it's room N142 i believe

they have the doors at tech hall locked, youll have to go through the fire exit by the loading bay
i could get into parsons whenever i wanted if i had my badge
i
di
dn
i didn't because i didn't know but you probably should
okay
it's the one that says fire exit
N142

like yeah fuck capitalism and all that but you arent doing yourself any favors. its a businessoriented degree
can i have the link
gay
turns out my 499 group made a C
bullet dodged
they finished the app too early and didnt the rest of the doc and assignments
probably a good idea
open box is usually fine
yeah i'd say go for it austin
and yeah
i'm really fucking glad i dropped
i mean
i'm not happy but i feel a it relieved about my decision
yeah
you banned uah from rateyourmusic just for web scraping right
like, they picked up where it was coming from and blocked the whole network
so they're gonna make an API for sonemic
idk why they're so strict on web scraping
boohoo, someone wants to pull their last rating in a discord bot
yeah LMAO
the social media manager shit annoyed me
like good for u
you started using the twitter
but aint you still got dev work to do
anyone on campus rn

CU

oh okay
holy fuck lol
that shit coleman always said isnt really wrong i guess
cs klub
free tendies
i saw dina the other day at tech hall
shes close to graduating
we talked about you john
anyone wanna get lunch
everyone
extremely gay
i need to call oasys like today
catch the recruiter on that friday mood
nice
oof
unlikely
but the day will come
180k is a lot for a chevy im pretty sure thad what your truck is
when are you gonna come visit
how long he been there
at vstech
he sounds like an ass
you think the qa lead is gonna get fed up
i got p lucky at parsons
my coworker and software lead are both chill people
dude mary allen is a great prof so far
i hope she teached 490 next semester
she's like dr uh
what's her name
the really easy one
lukins yeah
i actually don't know if dr lukins is teaching this semester
i didn't see her on the course menu
ah
you know
i think that might be for the best
she's the nicest teacher i've ever had
but she was too easy
i don't think she had the like, fortitude to let a student fuck up
i can't say i learned that much in her classes
i guess that's why i like allen cuz she has that nice mom vibe but her lectures are better and she doesn't seem like a pushover
yeah i'm not gonna like 490
yeah i wish i could take 390 again
she's teaching it
but it would be a waste of my time from a credit perspective
bruh
it was awful
she like
was just all over the place
i feel like i could have learned so much more with allen
or understood stuff better
her accent was really bad
i made a damn C in that class
now
part of that was on me
when i was on my bullshit
we had a few
the perl one was tough iirc
but
perl is cool
v pretty language
imo

check this out
i don't know if i wrote it like shit or not
but i remember staying in the library till close working on this
me ustien6596 are you in cu
oh
are you at cu
cool, ill come hang out and read a bit
lmao
2018 wild
i rescinded my application to shipt in birmingham
idk if i told yall about that
but i got an interview with shipt
and decided to stay here and take classes
it would have been a SICK gig
but
moving to bham i don't think it would have worked out
and i would have been miserable
even if i was closer to my gf
i woulda lived in homewood
the interview process was kinda crazy though
after the phone interview, they gave me a take home test
then after that, if i passed
on site interview, and expect to be there for like 5 hours
pair programming, talking to the entire team, all that shit
kinda wild
yeah it was serious
but shipt seems like a genuinely cool place to work
has the full startup vibe
but its in bham
and they been around a solid 4 years
i'll be really, really happy if i can work at oasys
i'm gonna get on that
the guy damn near promised me a job
yeah, after i graduate and can move away
i do plan on moving to bham if things go well with my gf

maybe
deets
oh cool, let me knowwhen you hear more
i'm gonna go through with the oasys thing since it seems like my best choice
idk what's gotten into but i'm ANXIOUS for my next class
like i hate only taking two classes
yeah let's hope
don't know if you're into the debate on work hours and worksharing but i found this to be really interesting

then a debate

parsons and oasys both gonna be there
this prof's book is trash
it's written like ass
metadon
uah defiintely feels busier than ever
people who use you do realize x, right are generally shitty people
lmao
not very professional
hope he gets fired and replaced speedily
i should probably go to the one in the spring
idk when or if my clearance is gonna get past interim
i think it takes up to a year
or more
iirc if you move jobs the company you work for has to reactivate it right
idk where my clearance stands
since i left parsons while it was interim
i gotta hit up oasys
maybe i can work there
so the 10 year expiration date is if you're employed
and it expires after 2 years of unemployment
didnt know that
that's interesting
yeah fuck that
idk i'm personally not looking to work a job that requires a security clearance after school
i'd need one at oasys
i'm gonna call them
i could def work there with my schedule
i'm looking for like
1520
just something to get by
wow that's sick
i will say
the closer you work to the government, the more lenient they can be
it just aint for me
would you wanna watch the stream today
i'll get er goin then
live now
i done had me a pretty good stream
caught like 4 big fish
holy shit man
glad youre all right
id get your car checked out just in case
that would save gas money
is her work on the way or something
so i decided to take some classes this semester
just two
cloud computing and client/server architectures
what are you taking
ah okay sweet
i almost took op systems but decided on cloud computing cuz of the teacher
it's this morning at 940 right
that's when cloud computing is
i'm sitting in 327
mary allen is teaching cloud computing
i like her a lot
wish she was teaching client/server as well
BUT
the author of the textbook for that class is also the prof
the textbook is used for cloud computing as well
lol
found it on libgen
fuck the prof
hit up libgen
i might have the op systems book
i can't remember
WHAT THE FUCK
HOLY SHIT JOHN
JOHN
DUDE CONGRATS
BOEING THE FUCKIN MVP
then again
i met an intern at boeing here for the summer at a party
they paid her 30/hr
she's fucking 19
donny ain't never gonna have to work again
real housewife hours
things start falling into place
i'm fucking hyped about these classes
finally some stuff i've been wanting to learn
why's that
if there's multiple results found it shows all of them
uh
yeah
you dont get overtime
lord forgive me but this dip aint gonna pack itself
what the fucc
im gonna stream some warframe
you gotta check this game out
live now
i'm also listening to some all pigs must die
fits the mood of the game better
aight cool
honestly might be streaming warframe
this game is way too fun
i'm streaming some warframe again

lmfao
he didnt strike me as the particularly religious type
bet his counseling is christian oriented
anyone want to watch me stream some warframe
he seems kinda dim from what youve told us
i wonder if hell keep his job
yikes
what the
oh wel
free money
yeah
i would be too
that shit is annoying
why is he on it again
using YOUR keyboard
tell him to move to his computer
i hate people who are fucking clueless to how their actions are affecting others
do it
i would lmao
hell yeah
im at the psychiatrists
gonna get one some anxiety medicine
everyone i'll stream for a bit if anyone wants to watch
was thinking playing some thou or primitive man
700 a month holy fucking shit
that's paying rent twice and it's never recommended to pay the min
that's fucked
fuck private loans
regular employees got small raises each year at parsons
maybe vstech doesns oemthing like tat
like a second or one that pays more
i would negotiate with vstech first
if they really want you they might give you a raise when you explain your loan situtaion
they saw that potential in you
how much you makin right now if you dont mind my asking
can dm if you'd rather
well
if you do min payment on the loans
and rent is 800 after utilities and internet and shit
that's just a guess
aw shit
well
okay
1700 utilties and shit
yeah that wasd my next thing
biggest thing i would recommend is trying to do more than min loan payment
whats your budget like per month usually
solve that gas variable
idk living at omas sets you up the best but damn dude
idk if i'd have the mental fortitude to do it
you live kinda far away from work right
oof
ah
traffic
streaming right now if anyone wants to watch
are you watching my stream brannon
everyone streaming some maps if anyone wants to watch something different

a changed it a bit
i think what will really make or break their album coming out is whether or not their song writing is good
what little they have has been kinda inconsistent
i would love if they did a screamo/black metal thing though
oh yeah page ninetynine
true og
check this shit out. i'm proud of me


thats a sick shirt
im definitely streaming today to test that script out
i need to touch some stuff up like putting stuff in try blocks so a bad search doesnt shit the bed
oof
i gotta stop streaming so much

data allowance is running out
im gonna lower my resolution to 720p
im gonna lower my resolution to 720p
yous interested in watching me stream rn
starting in a sec
i'm listen to the new birds in row

one sec
gotta fix something
okay should be good now
i gotta catch more twitchbeards
shit sold in a couple horsfor 200k gil

i could have gotten more money out of it
yeah
400 gigs a month
man yall gots to move out of omas
my dad just wont pay for more
i told him the 1tb option was worth it for like 10 bucks more
hed never have to worry about a data cap again
but yeah ill stream when you get home if you wanna watch
and john youd like fishing in ffxiv
theres over 700 fish
yall ever played warframe

makes you feel like a badass
brannon when you get your pc back we should try warframe
the tutorial sold me on it
oof
yeah
ye
stream is back


look at the comments
this guy is
actually calling prim man wannabe deathcore
yeah the comparison to PM was pretty bad from the start
lmao
the new thou stuff is more abrasive than their older stuff i will say
but
it ain't no primitive man type stuff
that band got ties to deathgrind
and yeah
it is easy to forget
yeah
some of the people i've met on ffxiv are just 18
one is 16
the emoviolence tag is getting a little overused
people are trying to use it on portrayal of guilt
when they're pretty squarely a screamo band
you ever listen to the new single
it's kinda dope
i think they're going a black metal direction
with some screamo influence
i did that shit
airplane cabin noise
idk what to call the first half of the new single though
it's this pretty grimey almost sludge sounding thing
you should give it a listen and tell me what you think
idk what to really call it
dude they are
they did that thing with street sects
yeah
that black metal passage was pretty sick imo
i was gonna just vote atmo black metal on the release on rym and see what people thought
they lost a member i think
oh shit
holy fuck justin
yeah that might be the issue
that is crazy shit i hope he makes it
yeah i fuckin hope so
dear father god our lord in heaven
my aunt does like that
does shit
the bible and baptists embellish fucking everything
the bible is written like shit
in a CHURCH
start playing my stream at max volume
oh
play it anyway
i gotta promote
damn son
check out what my friend just made me for my stream

super nice and clean looking now playing overlay
hell yeah mane
AW SHIT
HAPPY BIRTHDAY I JUST REMEBERED
idk how i forgot this time
prob cuz we aint around each other lately
there's a shit ton of fishing holes in ffxiv
okay so i just updated the target picture
it's got the green gradient
that means it's a big fish
i'll lay out some of the mechanics of fishing in ffxiv
the ability mooch lets you use the last fish you caught as bait
but the fish has to be high quality
and only certain fish can be mooched
some big fish require double or triple mooch chains
that's the most basic fishing technique in ffxiv
also
you can tell when i'm about to get an HQ catch when i pull up the fishing pole with a full hand
it's pretty crazy man
there's so much you can do
full fleshed out gathering and crafting classes
fishing is kind of its own endgame
lmao how so
ayyy nice
i should catch a salmon
which one
the sandy one
or the one i'm at now
oh yeah it's cool
i caught my target tho
i'm gonna stop streaming in about 12 mins
when this window closes
no prob dude, glad you enjoyed the stream
i wish i could make oney doing this shit lol
hm
gonna stream some more today i believe
oh yeah i meant to tell yall
i got a phone interview for a QA Analyst position down in birmingham
i'd be on the software dev team and everything
shipt is hiring a boatload of people
most don't require degrees
just nice to have
stream is up now, gonna start in a sec

i need to write a python script that pulls the current target's picture from ff14angler
ah yeah
so the overwatch patch hit and my friend wanted me to play
but then
5000 player queue
so rip
i might stream later
right now i'm trying to get the funds together for monster hunter world
which i will DEF stream
i bought monster hunter
gonna kill some monster shits
selfless teacher grind don't stop


i refunded MH
i wasn't impressed
i need day money for my ffxiv sub anyway
gotta keep fishin
dude if i could figure out how to make enough money on streaming to just pay my sub i'd be happy
i have the time but not the patience
i felt like fighting a monster was more about running away from it and healing yourself
it pissed me off
and the controls were a pain in the ass
press LS to run such shit
i think my stream is fucking up
god dammit
we good now
what do you think of the little now playing thing

i only spam my channel here
i prob will be
i got my setup working to where i can be in a voice call on discord and my stream won't hear it
so i can just casually stream and do whatever
you gotta get in here
i'm tryna catch giant takitaro and namitaro
what
i think you told me
that is some real shit right hthere
hell yeah mane
is your typing experience more enjoyable
oh yeah
i got that tome
were catching that sum bitch tortoise today
i liked it when it rained at parsons
it was very comfy
lights off
was ready to take a nap
im so excited to fish today
company funded lamp shits
oh yeah if you get 1 addicted using your keyboard at work and 2 feeling like its too loud, but a leopold keyboard with cherry silent reds. theyre super quiet and basically sound like youre average keyboard.
i'm gonna shower and eat and then probably stream
i am really tempted to change the music up some and play... other stuff
i'm gonna go live in a sec
stream is up
actually hold on
music should be playing
live now finally
i can

i'm just farming some daio squids
okay sweet, let me get set up

aight i'm streamin
i'm gonna catch one more of these dudes
then do something else
can you hear the game
i'm glad you think so
i just sit here and catch fish for 2 hours
watch this
yeah
on my head
minions go on lalafells' heads
the taller races, it goes on their shoulder
i was explaining to brannon
i'm farming these squids for these things called scrips
i can use them to buy books that let me catch more fish
there are 700 fish in ffxiv
ha
one day
right now the stream is focused on getting big fish
they're harder to catch and more rare
yeah
you gotta lot of work
more devs will be hired im sure
by the way im gonna stream some more later if you wanna watch

i'm streaming
oh fuck yeah
let me know how the stream sounds volume mixing wise
so i didn't realize it but ffxiv has over 700 fish
how's my voice ac unit probably makes it sound like ass
idk what's up with the stream
my dropped frame rate is awful
i caught him tho
idk if the stream was still functioning at that point
well this sucks
idk what's up
i restarted my computer
we might be good now
i lowered the output
oh okay
i'm goin after mountain kraken lmao
wish my stream wasn't fucking acting up
idk why it is
the fraem rate sucks
lmao at this song
i shouldn't have picked this target lol
it's too hard
for stream
yeah gonna skip that one
dunno if you're checking chat but i'm aboutt o fish for the rarest fish in the game
one of them anyway
0.8 uptime
stardew valley is fun
i'ma have to stop streaming
my luck is SHIT today

i added an overlay to show the current target and its name
i was having issues so i started sstreaming again
well
i caught my target
after i stopped my stream

gonna turn this into a panel tho

fun ass game
there's fishing in it
but i don't like it all that much
i'm gonna start streaming again

i changed my name and shit
added some panels
just to make my channel look at least half assed
im streaming now
im going for the FUCKING meteortoise again
the framerate issues seem to be gone

fishing in ffxiv
do you have a 3ds
fishing in animal crossing new leaf is pretty great
it's not as varied as ffxiv
obviously
but it's fun and good bells if you want to play the game in full
or just start playing ffxiv

i couldn't really get into fishing in stardew valley
it's hard
i believe there's a decent FTP fishing game on steam
i've never played it

i never rerally cared for it irl. i'm more of a fishing minigame person
lmao
maybe a realistic fishing game would be good for you then
holy shit dude

i played the fuck out of this when i was a kid
yeah dude
if it wasn't this game exactly it was something just like it
maybe they ported it to the PS1
it's actually kinda crazy just how much stuff there is to do in ffxiv
the crafting and gathering systems are fully fleshed out
you can be a
armorer, weaver, leatherworker, goldsmith, culinarian, carpenter, blacksmith, alchemist, miner, botanist, and fisher
some people have them all leveled to 70 are in pretty rich in game
my neighbor just bought an item off the market board for 15 million in game currency
oh shit that looks fun lol
i think the library is hiring sierra
for a clerk
ouch
looks good though
revature was like that
some girl named amy with a really bad accent over the phone

josh ghosted my gf
im pretty pissed off with josh rn
he fucking
INSTANTLY was like hello id like to interview you and when she said she could fly down to do so, he said nothing
and didnt even reply to me
my gf lives in tulsa OK
and yeah i get it, its easier to hire someone in state
but come on, she offered to fly here
how easy can she make it
and he never replied
she would establish residency here and everton g
everything
yeah
idk
im desperate for money tho
i have no income aside from selling off my keyboard collection
im hoping oasys calls me
im gonna call them
hes too busy idk either
look
i like josh
but yall is right
he aint a good teacher and i think hed e a shitty boss
im not taking that class again
my advisor gave me a plan and im sticking to it
fuck that
i havent seen dina in a hot minute
god dammit
dina has a job and i dont
kms

yall got any jobs
shes dim
the rest was loans or my dad helping with books
oh yeah
im super lucky
but my scholarship is gone
so i have to figure that out
scholarship saved my ass
yeah
i need to talk to my dad
ill take max kind and hopefully hell help me out the rest of the way
max loan
i want to avoid private loans
right now my loans are federal
yeah
well
i cant do a full year on 7.5k
which is mac federal loan
for a year
max
no
oh worn
worm
i need to sign up
i keep forgetting lol
everything gonna be waitlisted
w/e
yeah
i just wanna he done
be
yeah
it feels worthless
even though its not
im scared im gonna relapse or some shit and drop out again
yeah
some people get lucky
shit i was one of em
parsons was GOOD
after that pay raise
like
you get into a place that wants to hire you after you graduate
have roy been looming for jobs john
you been looking
they wont will they lol
such bullshit
i hate companies here
they want clearances already
fucking cheap skates
yeah
yeah
idk dude most of them want a clearance
like 70 from what ive seen
its such trash
how the fuck you supposed to get one if you wont sponsor
thats the issue with hsv
the COL and job pool
it like
makes you scared to leave
austin is yeah
but its also boring, relatively
i do wish i worked downtown in hsv
it would be cool
yeah
i dont want to do dod at all
i basically have to leave
i dont think i could get in somewhere in the space dept
i aint got the skills
but i would love to do something in that field
someone is literally in their office wayxhing something in the dark at almost 10pm downtown
half the  paycheck or so
thats a good plan
how much monthly income is this based on
thars a fucking shit ton brannon
i guess you can do that bc no rent
yeah
well thats good shit because thats an easy easy down payment on an apartment
so minimum payment each month and then end of year half of what youve saved right
seems solid
just keep that interest off
and go extra each month if possible
i think after this year ill be about 20k in the hole
maybe 25k
you always get dealt tough hands justin
but dude youre here rn and have a plan
youll get through
yeah
oh shit
oh wow
thats dope
a big deal
yeah
thats a blessing
idk what im gonna do for loans
85 of my school was scholarship and shit
anyone want to grab a beer at green bus in the next 30 mins
they close at 10
damn
yeah my friends have work as well
i have class but not till 1240
wbu
i just got back from jeffersons
had too many long islands and cant drive yet
nah
i live upstairs at my parents house
20 mins away from dientown
downtown
right near new market
ah yeah
i wish i lived closer

thats fucked
wow
yeah lmao
if i stay here
i want to live in madison
but i think ill end up moving to birmingham
which kinda sucks
gf will be
how was it
i mean
bham is more fun than hsv
no doubt about it
ah shit
yeah
i think id have fun
hsv is too small
it gets a little boring going to the same places now that a21 closed
i miss that place so much dude
yeahhhh
/
shiiiit
yeah its a special place
it is definitely home
the real dream is some place like seattle
i think id like nashville too
you prob couldnt
streaming if anyone wants to watch
beats incl., ofc

WHAT THE FUCK
I APPLIED AND FOLLOWED UP WITH AN EMAIL AND HE NEVER RESPONDED
congrats but damn im a little salty
software developer
at cyburity
what is it exactly
is it full time shit
or part time
oh okay
yeah i was pretty disappointed when i heard zero back
i applied on indeed
yeah ill send it to ya
75k are you kidding me
holys hit
my expectations have lowered to about 60
ish
my engineer friend makes 57k
i just wanna work with a high level language
give it a few hours
that shit's gotta diffuse
i gotcha dude, sometimes you have to air this stuff out
it's not good to bottle it up
try to make it through today, and escape to work tomorrow, if things are looking a little better
i know marissa is hot headed but i'm hoping she'll calm down some later today
cuz you're right, storming out like that isn't right
my gf has a sleeping disorder as well and oma needs to come to understand how hard those disorders are
nah not right now
i'd call her in a couple hours if you don't hear anything
keep a close eye on her location tho
to me it sounds like she just needs to chill tf out
i think it will do both of you good to just get away from oma, yeah
yeah it really sounds like she needed some sensory deprivation or something
yeahhh i'm agreeing there, a day or two at a hotel might do a LOT of good
and yeah i can see that, i think maybe it wasn't the time for that
but i also udnerstand your concern
cuz nashville aint the safest
i wouldn't dwell on it tbh
it might have set her off
but
i think things were gonna get rough either way
i think that was just the trigger you know
well
here's what i'm thinking
it's not gonna do you any good to worry about that stuff rn
it's a completely valid thing to worry about, but not tonight
and trust me, this is jsut from experience
my gf gets onto me all the time for getting all worked up over shit that's downt he road or otherwise out of my hands
well
what's important right now is recognizing all the things have been stressors on the relationship
and i think it's oma
and living with her
it doesn't surprise me marissa lost her cool first
i woulda lost my cool way earlier tbh
just to be clear, are you worrying about what this implies about your relationship
we can talk in dm if you want
you got an update
ill third

streasming new deep dungeon on ffxiv
i wish you'd shut the fuck up john
for me it depends
i like small patterns on shirts sometimes
like this
if you find the right tie to match it looks nice
my default is the diagonal stripe
yeah
anyone want to watch me stream

streaming if anyone wants to watch

everyone we gotta go to green bus together sometime
a brewery
downtown
you guys would like it
yeah mane come down
they got IPAs and stouts
youd like campus 805 too
they got some heavier stuff
yeah i am
i just had a white stout
oh, well im with some people you dont know
i think were goin to humphreys in a bit
but for real id love to come here with this server
wed have a blast going out
you def should
yeesh
i was kinda worried shit wasn't gon' pan out too long with oma
i remember you telling us a couple years ago she's real loud
marissa just needs a night to chill it would seem
you and marissa had a fight
or you/marissa and oma
well
shit
yeah
well
i was gonna say
give marissa some time to chill out
and then prob stay with her tonight
oma needs some space too it would seem
ack, yeah def not right now

streaming if anyone wants to watch
i saw like ten of them slowly crossing the street the other day
you shoulda said well if you wanna hog the entrance you might as well go do my job

streaming
basically
nah this is uh
Pax
so
is it good practice to make classes in python in their own file
i need to restructure my bandcamp scraper to be oop
say i want to make a Album class and a Track class
Track inherts some of the data within Album
basically
let's move to
i'm streaming again for a bit

anyone still got that file
i cant get it to play on my phone
anyone else here hate john
youre just made because you are angry
i have a bot and you dont

damn ben
why you still up
if thats blue and yellow id say no
im probably just biased
i dont like yellow in most cases
the most ill do is a yellow stripe in a diagonal stripe tie
i tend to go low contrast between my tie and shirt
its some special they do every 6 months
nope
ao
lmao
theyre strong
and delicious
just expensive sometimes
yeah dude
i got one at voodoo lol
thankfully im done drinking
i cant do it no more tonight
its weird getting trashed at applebees
i will say
but the specials are just too good
well
a21 was our place

campus 805 had a belgian dubbel brother joseph
i got a cocktail cuz im a bitch

clear liquor just aint good in most cases
spiced rum is def better

spontaneous tuesday night
went to humphreys with my sister
campus 805, lone goose, voodoo, now applebees lol
my friends do this all the damn time
idk how
oh yeah
chris is a super good guy and bought everything at lone goose tho
we tried to go to humphreys again but the wait was like 40 mins
shame
their fries are unmatched
yeah
well
its been weird
straight to ale was basically dead
voodoo was moderate
humphreys was packed probably because jeffersons is closed
and apple bees is kinda lit tbh
dude
ive gotten fucked up at applebees twice
1 long island iced tees

oasys doesn't havea nything immediately

a few times i got fucked over on the weekend cuz i went and they were locked

apple store is max cringe
i'm going android boys
never will sit at this here Genius Bar ever again
phone finally fixed
my screen had a mind of its own
it was awful
they replaced the entire phone
mine seemed more severe
yep
thats where they went
theyve already been there
so idk why
/
tech hall got a door open usually right
like they lock the doors during the weekend
but there's one that stays unlocked
i thinki'm gonna go for it
it'
s
too damn hot in my room
i moved upstairs and the window unit just cant keep up with the heat in the attic
i ended up stayin here
and i recall them locking the doors on weekends
they have a word of mouth place there that's supposed to be like a speakeasy
its' good
i've been there
i tried one shitty beer where thy sell 50 beers this place sucks
when is brannon coming here for beer
is marissa keeping her last name
or is she takin brakefield
gets me thinkin idk what caroline would want to do
it doesn't matter to me
that's breaking top protocol
Donald Downey
what's his las tname again
o
hamblin
it does
i would, no lie, consider taking caroline's name because i hate my own last name so much
never again would someone fail to pronounce my last name
could just change it to clout yeah
that's the most common one
clow
i went to high scool with someone who's last name was gough and they had the weird pronunciation like my name has
she's on drugs now
unless they do random drug testing
probably
i applied to this place called revature the other day

it sounds kinda cool
i applied to some other places
yall remember Chumz
they have an unpaid internship here lmfao
yeah
she ran away or something
iirc cayli ehas her kid
or did
idk
oh yeah she did
so wtf happened to brittany
did she died
she aint posted to instagram in 1.5 years
oh worm
huh
ays she lives in madison
i had a crush on her when she moved here
lmao
i saw him at walmart last month
it was weird
lmao
well
lots of people go tfucked up on drugs it seems
i still don't know if brandon is doing better
was there a uah hanger on the rearview mirror
can i please get a waffle
bruh
huntsville of all places
everyone we should go out to eat again soon

that's pretty good advice tbh
i adhere to some of that already
yall wanna go see Hereditary with me at monaco

tfw i forget to type brannon and just send the  emoji
tesla is cutting 9 of its employees
lol
that's reportedly 4.1k jobs lmao
flip
pic
shiiiit
i need a denim jacket so bad
gay
wow lmao
you ever wear slacks 3 times your size
josh don't give a fuck
WHAT MOVIE
caps
ghost of tsushima or whatever it was called looks so fucking good though
rpg hack n slash
kingdom hearts as a concept is stupid as shit to me
tbqh
i just moved upstairs
its so much nicer up here
way more room
and sunlight
near my desk
you getting one at vstech
i'm buying some book on javascript and jquery
vstech use bootstrap
nope
boostrap is a breeze
now you get to just chill for a bit
have a mini summer
it wanted to die
give me u fuckin money
weems is going to kill me
what
why
OOF
this ain't in cleveland is it
idk how far away cleveland is from nashville
yeah
ia friend and my coworker both went to a religious school
they get busted for ditching chapel
they couldn't have actual greek life
they were called some weird term
i guess i'm surprised a religious school has a sick pharma program
i reckon that makes a lot of sense
i got a phone interview for a data entry position
honestly
a used corolla is the best choice
the most responsible one
AYYYYY
congrats dude
i've heard tesla has fucking hrrendous working conditions
some of the worst
he refuses to let his employees unionize
it's not no
but i don't think elon musk should be praised when he does the same shit
that's not what i'm saying
yes
at the cost crushing work conditions
it's not right
same with jeff bezos. he's bat shit crazy
you all know i'm a bit on the anti capitalist side of the spectrum here
we got some fundamental disagreements
my point is it's very strange to me to idolize someone for their accomplishments when it comes at the cost of human labor abuses
i don't idolize any big capitalist
he did
my response was uh
overexagerrated
lol
i want that same output that doesn't come with the absurd profits and crushing human labor
you know
there was some shit about bernie's wife and fraud
like a year ago
idk what came of it
i know lots of companies are against unionization
at the end of the day i need a car
but it won't be a tesla
mainly cuz they're expensive and not a necessity
the concept of owning a car generally is, a tesla isn't
which has advantages
and i'd like to see that implemented across the car industry in general
like the old days
actually
i had a dream either last night or the night before last that we were watching a vine comp
school next year is going to be lonely without yall
buy it
what's wrong with it
and what model of car is that actually
my gf wants a wrx
i remember
no way
elon musk is BAD NEWS BITCH
he's like
one of the new robber barons
fuck that shit
he has some weird cult of personality
because he makes jokes on twitter
his wealth
and he's anti union
brannyboy did they kill you
ha that's kinda how it was at parsons
father and son interviewed me
yeah i feel the same way
i think i'd get a little restless thoug
no
lol
buying a new car at the age of 23 is really stupid
they should know that
well
maybe not
it is your uh
family
what kinda car do they want you to get
your dad's a mess dude
jfc
it's real weems hours
she's cringing me out
sounds like she's being enabled, big time
OOF
i thought they were both on opiods
opiates
however its spelled
nikki is a messy bitch
i'm glad you're out o fthat shit sierra
well
for the most part lmao
what shit are they pawning electronics
weems won't stop talking about herself
smh
no gunz bois
i can't remember if i made that
chub n tuck was legendary
when are we all going out for a drink
john too whipped

perfdect battle jacket
size too small
kms
we could go to humphreys and get some fries and drinks
the fries are best in the town
weird
well
whatever
maybe something will come from it
yeah they will
god i wish that were me
i just want to be hired
i'm going to hit indeed hard after class today
omw to weems hell
i'll see
in taking tech writing and a telecommunications class
it's really just the network cert prep class
oh fuck
nice
what's the company
let's hope mane
i remember you saying the commute wasn't th best but
that's not a big deal
weems already struggling with the computer
that's true
wow some dude just casme in here and was like no food and drink
to someone in here
i've never seen anyone who works here give a shit
yeah weems doesn't know what she's doing
lol
yeah she aint know how to get to her flash drive
SHE REMEBERS ME
NOOOOO
there's like 4 christophers in here
what the fuck
yeah
she's bragging again
she ain't changed
weather isn't looking too good
that's not bad
pretty good money
entry level
well, maybe they're looking for new graduates
nice
here's hoping
i haven't heard a peep back from anything i've applied to
except that one job with the shitty hours
yeah
shits kinda ridiculous
i might start saying i'm interested in those recruitment messages from indeed
see if it leads me anywhere lol
steal them
i got blocked from a couple places because i didn't have a cover letter
so i need to write one
i'm on indeed myself, idk if she is. i need a linkedin. which means i need a profile pic lol
i get messages from employers on indeed
but i've declined them wll
all
i think they don't realize i'm still in school
i get software stuff
but mostly embedded type stuff
that's the best thing you can do
i'm tellin ya, if it comes down to it, i'm just going to get something at belk again
i need money
i want to learn more webdev stuff
i want to bea on real dev team so bad dude
well
you cold get a couple certs for help desk/desktop support stuf
yeah same
i'm guessing you're officialy committed to nashville now
that would devastate me for a bit
ally's fiance is making 57k
when i was full time at parsons i was making bout 38k yearly
ofc i never did that
thats bout 40k yup
i was am techincally at 19.23
for some reason
that would definitely help with loans
if you avoided rent for a couple years
but yeah
i'm at the point where as soon as i can, i think i'm jumping ship from my parents place
i cant deal
i need to get away from family
living with someone elderly would drive me insane even faster
that's ass
that real adult stuff
shiver
i guess it's really important to consider what matters the most to you money or peace of mind
ain't no easy choice
right now i'm leaning toward peace of mind
that's a pretty big no no in house management
especially when you want to sell
my goal right now is
apartment paying most of own monthly expenses stable income
just revert to twinkle brannon
wow lol
you gonna look into them
nice
yeah maybe not
good move
hopefully they like that
i start weems's tech writing class tomorrow
assuming i make it home, that is
lol
i think i could adapt fairly easily
but
i'm rusty in java too
i'm just rusty in general.
i've read about how people think java is nothing like c and if you're writing java code you're doing it wrong
yeah
at parsons it was hard for me to let go of doing things right
and instead just doing them fast
it worked out in the end
that's neat
i get way too wrapped up in being a good programmer dude
the dept i'm in at parsons is not that kind of place
yeah
same here
parsons didn't really have any expectations. it was just like please write this so i was like ok and used design patterns
the job market just confuses me
i lucked out with parsons that first summer
that's dope, did you feel like school prepared you for it somewhat
i was really thankful for coleman my first summer at parsons
i would have been SOL without 307
definitely
i will say 321 was nice, getting to work on a team
but 499 trumps that one
i'm taking it next spring
i'm kinda scared
it's mostly because idk the class below us you know
i'm gonna show up and these 1997 kids are gonna be like who tf are you
yeah, i wanna be a team player
i'm going to try to get reacquainted with OOP stuff before then
if i could land a software job......
well, the platforms didn't really call for it
yeah
time constraints and shit
when in doubt use a simpleton lol
i'm definitely ready to get into a company that focuses on real good design and development
instead of mashing stuff together to get it to work
yeah i'm a little scurred the bubble is popping man
and you have to go to fucking seattle or san francisco and join a start up and live with 8 other roommates
lol
stay diligent
i don't think they teach us how grueling the job hunt really is
so you submit like 50 apps and get 2 interviews and you're like wtf
thing is
we're pushed to get out in 4 years
and it's hard af to get out in 4 and work
yeah
you have to find someone who is willing to let you work just here and there during school
parsons was like that
how many apps you think you've put in
that's what i guesstimated to caroline
she's been really bummed about finding a job
and she hasn't put nearly that many in
yeah that's a good minimum
just get something out there
once i get home imgoing to ramp things up
taco bell's avocado ranch sauce makes me horny
the chicken chalupas are soooo fucking good
dude i want a tuft and needle so bad
which mattress did you get
i mean like what brand
caroline wants to know
cuz she's in the market for one
gimme a 10k mattress
it's on the chicken chalupas
it's fucking amazing
it's in the mild baked chicken chalupa
naked
did you get one
god damn
did DG fall through
huntsville makes me feel trapped
usa.txt
so
world is fucked
89482894640148 dead college graduates
it's pretty frustrating to see people not hiring you
you even have work experience
fellas
let's start a website company
we have the means
just not the money
yeah
have never touched c sharp
so i've heard
but if you have the means, don't cheap out
yeah TnN mattresses run over 700 iirc
long term cheap ones can fuck your back up
a good mattress is high on the list of stuff i want when i get stable
yeah that's good advice
same applies for high use chairs too
me neither, i have a hand me down kinda whatever one
same ours were like
1k or some shit
i want one from ikea
i have a decent desk
it's a walnut one built in the 50s but it wasn't stained well
me too
i sit with my keyboard far away from me
so it's gotta be kinda deep
my gf has a decent desk from ikea
i want to get a butchers slab or something
i want a piece of wood rested on top of a couple drawers
basically my gf's desk lol
oh that is a sick table
yeah
something like that tabletop wise
yeah i can get one later
simple desk, wood top, metal legs, two drawers on the right side
yeah that'd be cool
a daunting project
but doable
LOL
woodworking seems pretty sick
my old boss has a whole shed where he does woodworking
even has a toilet
i could see myself getting into that kinda stuff when i'm older
and have the tools and money lol
i'm gonna look into that

so this is what my Indeed resume looks like
idk if i's better nto use this one where possible on indeed or just upload my actual one
i like the additional info part
it gives me a space to talk about my dat entry skills
applying to software jobs again feels so fucking good holy shit
no experience but could learn
i have experience with java
go for it, that would be awesome
hell yeah dude, thanks
let me send you my updated one
i fixed it up a little today
my pc is clean installing so it will be a bit
hey ben, did you ever sell that yoga you had
i'd in the market for a new lappy

i'm thinkin bout this one
if you get a chance can you send me the model number
ah okay
thanks ben
how much you selling for
if you're still selling
ao
lmao
i want a pixel
i think it's what i'm gonna get
i'm just kinda giving up on iphone
your pixel
oh
i was about to say
my phone is shitting the bed
screen does its own thing half the time
oh damn
is it the black one

this one
oh okay
damn that is tempting
ah okay
i'll let ye know
nice
what kind
tuft and needle is what caroline wants to buy
nah her friend has one
they love it
it fixed his back problems
mattresses are one of the things you don't want to go cheap on
ofc u take what you can get
do you think i'm underqualified  for a clerical position
i haven't gotten any contact back
tbh i might get back into looking for a software job
since i'll be in school again
yeah
it might be easier now
ayyyy do you remember when were sharing resumes did you happen to download mine
if you have it still can you send it
i'm in tulsa and never put mine on google drive
ayyyy thanks a shit ton
i was going crazy trying to find it
apparently none of those company hiring profiles actually save yer resume
ofc
yeah, i kinda want to make one as well
do you have it popping up near the top when you search your name
lol
i know there's a legitimate way to do it
i just couldn't tell ya how
i just googled your name
it will probably take a day or two for it to crawl it
but
i recommend clearing up your soundcloud
mostly your soundcloud and youtube show up
but your github stuff shows up too
a picture of javon shows up LOL

and jonjon
mrrocknroll205
when i was 12 i was headbangsociety
so
no judging here
what's your website
yeah it's dead as hail
basically nothing comes up when you search my name
how much does it cost you a month to host the website
i wonder if you could make a text based DND helper bot for a DM
ah okay
might drive to louisville with caroline to get a dog
shew wee

chow chow/pomeranian mix
he's damn cute
we bout to hit the road boys
the dog is on hold
ardmore is a shit hole
why is the job market so BAD

maybe they'll pay for your masters
companies will do stuff like that
black only
i'm SHITTING
too bad he's too old
when you turn 40 your weregay form gets arthritis
Friend.......
caroline and i are playing around with a pi development kit she got
fucking owned
i think i would end up preferring it to backend stuff
having said that, i feel like i'm not good enough for any of it
we had some slides for the GUI stuff iirc
i don't think i got them all c
but i'll check
fellas
i'm officially back in classes

the new childish gambino is fucking great
the video i mean
that prayer was like
god and literally everyone but the students themselves did this
nah god is 'portant
he's why you graduated
he shook my hand and broke the other one

but then you get there
and realize it's super clean
like

lmao
i want more of those mini taco burgers
they're pretty good dude
literally the insides of a taco between a butter brushed bun
brannon's burg took awhile tho
they were growin' the mushrooms back there
brannon gets mushroom swiss burgers

damn
graduation is the 6th right
nahhhh
correct

kms

i was kinda fearing it was gonna happen
it was geting loose
i'm getting a new pair
yeah
i love em
i'm getting the black ones this time
worth the 20 bux
theys aint even 20 bucks more
maybe
everyone lunch
YALL AINT LIKE ME
is brannon dead
go back to work you might cost your boss one minute of productivity
brannon is a cuck to academics
john is a cuck to his boss
SO WHY DONT YOU EVER LEAVE
you sicken me
that's good too
i think i have enough space to include my related coursework but i was planning on ditching that once i graduated
i like the keywords part
i should add one of those
i think you could keep the relevatnxoursework section if you made it more like a comma separated list
maybe
although you could probably condense your emerson section a little and then have more to work with for your senior project

this is what i got right now
there's some stuff i need to add
and maybe change
once i get retroactive withdrawal squared away I can stick my major gps back on there
yeah there's some coursework in there i shouldn't include
i might change the skill summary to a keywrods section like yours
it does about the same thing
but looks better imo
probably a good idea
i've had a harder time getting a data entry job than i'd like
i've only heard back from that one place
and it was bust cuz of the hours
i like that too
good stuff
he used to be a somewhat prominent youtube personality in the cringey atheist community
idk
theamazingatheist
i don't think it's too bad out here right now
well he seemed like a dick
if this is the one who got upset with your questions

guy seems like a piece of shit tbh
sounds like it's him then, i wouldn't worry about it too much
idr if told y'all but i got an interview with someone in the arsenal
the first thing they told me in the phone interview was btw this is a 31130pm job can you do it
thanks asshole, don't put that on the job posting or anything
all it said was shift work which is too vague
i think so dude
employers are kinda stupid from what i've gathered
damn
that's lame as shit
at least you got to answer yes to that
oh yeah
the senior project is good for a resume
i think that's part of it tbh
for yer resume
yeah
you got like a technical skills section
I'd switch that header to Technical Skills and throw in every language you've worked with, every piece of technical software you've worked on, software development methods you're familiar with, etc
ill post mine too
you ever just sit in yer truck
i just ate way too much sushi
whatchee been drinkin
how is that
where'd you get it i want to find a dark i like
my heart will always be with cider but i haven't drank much at all lately
idr if i told you guys but i drank half a bottle of maker's in a night at carolines and ever since alcohol has had little effect on me and i don't ever want to drink it
i feel like it's mental
but i've been out a couple times and slammed quite a few shots and they haven't done jack shit
tolerance is no joke
i really overdid it that night
yeah i'm about the same way
i'm dangerous around maker's dude
ill over do it
every time
i sip it
i've never had irish whiskey
but basically
whiskey and bourbon is the stuff i like
yeah i know irish whiskey got that sweet smell
i'd like it i think
i love sweet shit
bourbon stings dude
idk how i drink it so much
it's not like it's fun
eh, the context is way different if it's craft
i don't drink hard liquor alone
i don't mind drinking alone, but under normal circumstances that stuff knocks me out silly and i get all sad
problem with what i regular is that it makes you kinda bloated
i wish cider didn't do that
and that i liked the taste of beer more
me too
well
now
used to be less
yeah, back like, 6 months ago, i was lit off a couple long islands
and then
a couple months ago, i got fed shots all night and never really felt drunk
it was annoying
lmfao
dude how is still alive
billy the fridge god damn
EW
wasabi makes me sick
just the smallest bit of it
wait
the drunken peasants
is uh
paul's ego on that
ah okay
yeah pauls ego is this lke
idek
everyone anyone wanna grab lunch
i'm at parsons so i'm around
my savior
kms

my work has been reduced to drawing rectangles and printing them
wbu
that's for work
there's a GPS board inside


this is play
ye

i'm letting it print while i go to work

er, go to lunch
the cool about it is
i use openscad
it's kind of a programmer's CAD software
i've been learning how to better code in it
it's similar to say C or Java
but it's got some weird quirks
papa john's ain't worth
a month ago russia claimed that america was gonna claim assad used chemical weapons and then bomb damascus
so
one of us is lyin'
i mean
russia was probably just trying to spread disinformation before the attack
but it would be pretty fucked if america was lying about this
i mean we could be as brainwashed as any other country out there rn
i definitely do not blindly trust our government
Playing Steam Login
really damn
what if it's that new shit they added
dope
fucking technical interviews
you got it mane
i will say
if you want a decent sub sandwich
the one at the caf are not bad
everything else i just get tired of
it's far from subway or anything
but it's hard to fuck up a sub so
put that SALT on it to make it spicy
it's tragic
the caf has better sody pops
than sandellas
fuck you john
i feel like the only motherfucker in the caf who isn't a freshman
i have fucking 50 meals left
if you want sandellas just hmu john
i should have paid for ya earlier, i just didn't think about it
you can st sandellas
i've bought two before so i could take one home
i think it might depend on what kind of meal plan u have
if you have x per week i think it locks you based on breakfast lunch and dinner
i just have 70 per semester
level 12 sounds like their standard software dev level
level 13 too ofc
can i add one of yall as a reference for this job app i'm doin
idk what else to do on the fly
hell yeah thank you justin
i done applied to bout 3 positions today
doo doo spray thru the phone....
meh yeah be careful there
don't want to get tied up in something like that
we'd all get sick of that shit fast af
what's the title of the position
associate is ultimate trap term
yer gonna be in sales and business
idk if i've talked about it but i'm trying to snag this Documentation Specialist job
some will say must be able to
those are da ones you're looking for
but idk, maybe some would be okay with you  not having one yet
my project lead explained to me your clearance goes inactive when you leave the company who got it for you anyway
so you have i reapply
well
it's a lot faster i think
yeah idk it seemed kinda weird when he told me
dude i have NO clue how my interim went through so fast
my coworker is still waiting on his
well i moved here when i was 12, and i had a couple foreign contacts
i've never left the country though and my coworker has
honestly i have zero interest in security clearance work once i live huntsville
leave
so much shut requires it here
shit
even just to like
digitize documents
you need a clearance to see that stuff because it's all government contract documentation
i think most of the jobs i'm actually trying to do require one or the ability to get one
start working at dominos before the guilt of working at papa john's eats you alive
no papa john's is dead
papa john himself is dead
dominos makes BETTER PIZZA
that's fair ben but we're talking pizza here
i don't like their pizza idt
i recall having it once
we have a local place here my dad always insists on getting because it's cheap
raphaels
their pizza
is ok
but so greasy and thin i've gotten sick of it
it's like real local
run by a bunch of mexicans
i get calzones from there sometimes
lmao
makes sense
local pizza so greasy
but
if you get a bunch of meats on any pizza it will be pretty greasy
i'm craving pizza and dnd now
okay yeah sam and greg's has the best pizza in town
it's just too pricey to consider any day
damn i hope that pans out for you justin
im talking to parsons this week about my current status
did y'all see the mr rogers documentary trailer
no kid no siree
the world does not need a second Me
someone on reddit found their moms list of biggest regrets in life for an AA meeting and the first one was having kids

the chick fil a near uah got that two lane drive thru
because god is smiling upon us today
can't wait for it to be april aka when it's 80, humid, windy, and you might die from a tornado every week

atta boy
fellas he's starting going along with it
toiletgirl84

you every schmack your head on a golf cart so hard it sounds like a baseball bat
he totally did
uah wifi shitting the bed
making as mess as we speak
lmao
i think they were 22s
it was ridiculous
one of the craziest cars i've seen in huntsville
it was spotless too
someone really gives a shit about that car
a white honda accord i cant believe it
thing was
it was a late model accord
that's why it looked so ridiculous
itnwas def the second pic
probably like a 2012 or newer car
most of the cars with rims i see are older models
WHAT lol
oh i saw some of that
but i couldn't read all of it
i just went back and read it lmao
good shit
yeah there were a bunch old people running around campus today
oh my GOD
i just saw
a white honda accord
with big tires/rims
with the license plate OMWTFYN which i'm guessing means on my way to fuck your nigga i'm fucking rolling
i wanted to get a picture
i can't believe someone did that to a fucking honda accord
the minivans of sedans
what's the diameter of standard wheels these were like half a foot wider
at least
have any of y'all watched season 4 of black mirror
i wasn't that impressed with it
it wasn't bad
just not as good as previous seasons

when you have normie friends who think they know what kind of person u are
i've been doing some transcription work on transcribeme and i'm liking it well enough
i got unlucky the first day my account was activated
all the files i got had hard accented english but its been all american accents since then
oh i aint seen he replied
after you do 20 bucks worth of work, you can request for it to be deposited in your payapl
rn im averaging about 12 mins per audio minute cuz im still figuring out how to be more efficient
yeah it's 20 bucks an audio hour
i think, tho, some files pay at 25 an audio hour
a bunch of mine have
they have a higher priority in the work queue
is ur slsk Logged On
i canceled my spotfiy sub for now so its big pirate time
how do i find you again
my user list never saves
added
although it says youre away
oh i was an hour late lmao
my therapist is at alabama psychological services center
definitely do that
i tried to get in back in november and they were booked, but they called me a few days ago about making an appointment
so hop on that asap
i think the uah counseling is free iirc
ye, do that tomorrow, there might be a spot open
i beieve they called me on monday
school/stress exacerbates mine
i think that's fairly common. it's definitely grounds for regular therapy
ye, it's understandable
the important part of recognizing when something isn't going right and contacting your doctor immediately
if i hadn't thought about it enough i might have stayed on zoloft for way too long
yeah
i gotta figure some of that out still
i learned about retroactive withdraw
oh shit
yeah i havent withdrawn yet because i wanna try to make this retroactive withdraw work
basically if you get sufficient medical docuementation, the dean of students can decide to change all of your grade from the previous semester to Ws instead of whatever you had before
i made a .25 gpa last semester
cuz of this shit
so basically
they would change everything to a W
which is a big fuckin deal
yeah
yeah i bombed
i didn't talk about it much
yeah, the retroactive withdraw thing was a big morale boost
basically it would be like the 20172018 school year didn't happen, at least if you looked at my gpa
ah yeah, it did work out in the end
yeah i was pretty scared last semester was just gonna be on my record unless i used all of my retakes
i'm not going as fast as i should but yeah i think the ball will get rolling soon
this transcription thing is a little exciting even it only means like 20 bucks a week lol

the hotkeys TM uses are okay but using your feet or something would be better
i took their entrance exam today and passed first try
most of my time spent was making sure i was adhering to their guidelines
they're a bit strict
weekly iirc
but i've read they dont pay out till you make 20 or so
i could be thinking of a diff place
weekly would be nice tho
where was this i was looking for a data entry place on indeed
didn't find anything that looked particularly good
shiiit
im gonna keeping looking
plan rn is to take a break from school and find something in data entry or clerical while i get my head right
ye. the most promising thing i saw was some construction company looking for data entry
there were several medical transcription jobs but they wanted some more serious employees, medical transcription certs and stuff like that
yeah, i got into therapy but she's really booked rn, so im out of an appointment till march. i set up a psychiatrist appointment for monday tho, so that's good news
what medication are you currently on
ive been on a few
ah i was actually trying to get on wellbutrin. my gf is on it. my doc told me he'd prefer if a psych prescribe me it so im on trintellix for now
i have problems with both, and idk which one is worse atm
like, axiety so bad i lock up and don't do shit even though im anxious about not doing it
its dumb as shit
i'd start taking it personally, it might help you cope. if you've gotten spooked about the side effects online and stuff i don't think they happen to the majority of people
i've never had bad side effects. pristiq made me kinda irritable though
i only ever took that in high school, and a real small dose
well that is definitely concerning. if that's an ssri that could be why you're on wellbutrin
ssris didnt work out well for me
i was on zoloft for a few months
i didn't give a shit about anything
it was nice not being anxious, but it was so bad i didn't care
yeah
i was in dreamland
couldnt be fucked to do anything
pristiq helped my mood for awhile but it def tapered off into more of a shitty irritable feeling, and missing a dose was horrendous
now im trintellix as of a few days ago, so idk about it yet. its expensive as shit
i honestly wanna go on wellbutrin
kinda the motivation for this psych appointment
are you currently in therapy

any of yall ever done athome transcription stuff
no
not all of them
i mean you gotta be not an idiot and recognize ones that aren't scams
yeah, transcribeme
i mean
im not 100 still
but its got indeed reviews and a glassdoor profile
hell no
this is like
supplemental income type thing
all good, your concern is v welcome
20 or so per audio hour

lmao
nope
lvl 67



edgy glamour
and yeah i miss it
i havent really gotten into other classes
i unlocked red mage but never leveled it really
im gonna level Monk tho
yeah it is
i leveled it for one level
super easy to play
the only thing about rdm is
you have to get another magic/war class to lvl 50
cuz rdm starts at lvl 50
the storyline has gotten REALLY good
i started enjoying it a lot more when the dragons got prominent in the storyline
white mage is honestly really fun at high level
you can do some good damage if you figure out how to manage your healing and damage focus
for ffxiv once you get to around lvl 50 you start to get more benefit out of doing both
the lower levels were defintely more about keeping your team alive though
i kind of what to try Scholar
lmfao
basically
ffxiv is really just playing dress up
they overhauled the glamour system
dude ive thought about leveling a warrior or paladin just for the cool armor in the game
or a dark knight
the tanks have some of the coolest gear in ffxiv
i don't really care for most of the robes for white mages
they don't look right on lalas

they actually just added this sweater like 3 weeks ago
add da bot
monkeynaut is aight

the graphics
wow
looks like realistic disney animation lol
very smooth and lifelike
i still gotta play cuphead yo
you know what i been kinda wanting lately
a card based dungeon game
like a procedurally generated dungeon crawling where you build a deck and each room got a enemy deck you gotta play through. can have items, loot, enemies, bosses, etc
idk sounds fun
huh
i wonder how many of those people before that moment were the kind of people who were sure of themselves they would get the fuck out of there if something like that happened
holy fucking shit
that's worse than i expected

i think you'd like the old fashioned one more
yeah i heard
homestuck fandom on tumblr
this world is disgusting
yeah
i haven't seen his identity
i think basically everyone is against his identity being revealed

this is a good article that talks about it without revealing his identity
im banky.
21 years old
yeah, i remember when h3h3 and other youtubers made videos about that genre
because their stuff was getting demonetized but the weird kids youtube vids weren't
like a honeypot or some shit
that's weird

this is really weird though
you can tell its all algorithmic
yeah
y'alls dad ever not talk to you for 3 days because you said no to eating cake on his birthday when you were half asleep
oh my dad finally said
so when are you gonna say something just now

hes like upset cuz i havent been answering his calls and texts apparently and also cuz caroline didnt have too much to say when she was here
sorry the focus of her visit wasnt meeting my fucking parents
oh she didnt really have a conversation with u
heartbreakin
weird how my dad starts acting this way the minute i start acting more independent without explicitly telling him i am
they were like
shocked
that i didnt tell them i drove to bham on sunday
yeah like
just because i brought her here doesnt mean she has to interact with you that much
its not like she cold shouldered them
small talk for a minute
then we went to my room
my parents are all torn up about it
i didnt even have to introduce them to her
kinda wish i hadn't lmao
the point of bringing her here wasn't for her to have a long conversation and spend time with my family
it was go in my fuccin room and listen to records cuz that's the only place we can do so atm
am i bein unreasonable here
they basically give you a large even if you ask for a medium, it's all the same price
i just ate SUSHI

kids youtube has always seemed off to me, but this article really explains the discomfort i haven't been able to explain myself
yeah
there's tons and tons of just automated videos using models of those characters
its the same exact video with the same elements rearranged over and over again
its really fucked up
could be
the article i linked doesn't really touch on that
more so how we've allowed a system like youtube to profit off the automated traumatization of children

this played out loud in subway once

you ever go to put gas in your car but the pump won't let you select a fuel grade so you go to next pump and it declines your sale so you go to a different gas station because you think the one you were just at is having issues but your card gets declined there too so you check your checking account and it turns out the other gas station withdrew all of the money from your card and has it on hold and now you're late for a test

yeah during uh admitted students day or something moriarity gave a presentation about something and my dad leaned over and whispered to me holy shit that's the woman who almost got killed
this woman sounds fucked up
guess its been proven
mane apparently the bitch has attacked someone in prison too
smh
CRABS BOMB
fuck, fr
i didnt know that
mane ive been watchingprison docs lately
i know they're sensationalized but i cant stop watching
probably treatment of prisoners and living conditions
damn
america's prison system aint right
i mean its not supposed to be comfy
but it has to be sanitary at least
people is wild
thats fucked
why did he even have those
i ordered something on amazon over a month agoand when i placed the orderthe thumbnail of the item didnt match what i boughbut the title doesand when i hit track package it just sends me back to the same pageinb4 skammed by japan
yeah the video sounded a little slow
that's why i'm thinkin
maybe the mans modded a semi
yeah
it was way faster than true semi
checks every other year mane
nah i highly doubt he was even radicalized
i think the mans is just a domestic terrorist
fucked in the head
you rght
white people definitely radicalize but isis takes pretty much every chance they can to claim responsibility for violence in america
one of our family friends lost her fuckin mind back in 2005 and went to DC to find bin laden
it was some time back then anyway
she got issues
severe bpd
i made th mistake of watching that video
that shit was brutal
yeah, that's why i think america's stance on guns is too lax
and we should as a country should make it harder than it is to do that
someone with a mental illness could obtain a semi automatic weapon
i wonder the aurora shooter used
he useda shotgun, teargas, and a sw mp15
i think some of the common sense gun laws like bernie sanders and hes colleagues have proposed should be widely accepted by now
you have to start somewhere and its clear america has a problem
/
yeah i think yer right
open carry kinda freaks me out but concealed carry can be abused
i think my band director from high school would stick a gun in the small of his back between his pants when he went out places lol
yeah
its gotta be holstered on your belt
p sure
but some people make a show of it
and that's what i dont like
i dont like the mentality of i will shoot you to kill you if i perceive anything you do as threatening to me
that's what i'm curious bout
i wonder if he modded a semi
the vegas gut
guy
i dont think ive ever seen an 8 am cs class, come to think of it
this schedule is kinda trash
i gotta go from 8am to 720pm twice a week
u reddy
oh 499 is on MW
like fr, ive never seen a cs class that early before
it seems like a good class tho
tbh
im kinda starting to move towards security stuff
i kinda like it
have yall ever taken the meyers briggs personality test
that shit intrigues me
i usually get infj
that guy would have killed 58 people with a knife so we shouldn't do anything about guns
it SOUNDED full auto
people act like just because bad people will get guns illegally anyway means we can't do anything about it
dude had like 10 guns or something
yes
the gun sounded auto in the videos
im not denying
ive heard rumors about every which way
i dont have the answers to that immediately. but its not like america doesnt have the means to combat illegal gun trade.
i cant remember if the pulse shooting was committed with an automatic rifle
semi
of course, but making them illegal would make them harder to acquire in the first place, and as i said again america's intelligence is some of the best in world. if we 1 treat guns as the dangerous tools they are, 2 take gun violence and mental illness seriously and 3 combat illegal gun trade, i could see things getting better
idk how that guy got ahold of 10 guns
dude had a literal arsenal
that's kinda fucked
im not really saying we should ban all guns
i want a handgun when i get my own place
my point is mass murders can be carried out with semis as we've seen in places like pulse
I'm gonna head over and hang at the dungeon till class
I have like 2.5 hours to kill
I'm omw in

throwback
life is pain
so is death
hey guys here's the review
shitty untitled word doc
i love josh
true
his way works, its just so sysadmin

WEAPONIZED BODY ODOR
when you have a tactical map of all the shitters in tech hall
is donny working toinght
i might go to the dungeon
wow john
you've bamboozled me

me

everyone

i have bought new shoes
if anyone wants subway in a little bit hmu, i have a coupon for 2 foot longs for 12 bux
it's on me

wbu
looks like shit kys
you're in 485 this semester right
i was thinking of taking it for an elective
i gotta take two in the spring
ooooh
josh is teaching that
i might do that
oof its at 8 am
brannon been watching eat dat pussy 445
is it all eagles stuff
or what
damn he's growing up
they work during the day
The shitty ones during the evening
y'all ever put your Instagram handle on the back of your jeep
tell them you'll report them for sexual harassment
implying gay men don't sexually harass women
true
when you on that manipulation shit
yeah mine stays on too
why are southern accents real
And I don't mean southern drawal
I mean
The nasally shit
my Spanish teacher taught us that
but do you know what I'm talking about
the like, intentionally nasally southern accent
yeah kinda
dudes will do it too
YES
fucking hell
drives me insane
are you still at tech
and yeah I think you get around 200 pages free
he got the entire country talking about it. donating aint gonna get people talking the same way the protest has
no, its a political discussion
not just a fad
plenty. the uproar has been because people want to cut a hole in the flag and fuck it
he doesn't think america is protecting the livelihood of black people
and yeah, that's a contradiction
no argument there
my point is, someone with his status and someone who is maybe less impacted by police brutality has even more of an obligation to stand for what he sees as injustice. donating and shit helps, but ffs, the civil rights movement used sit ins to cause political discussion
this is how it works
quietly donating isnt how you get society to talk about its problems, let alone shift its perspective on something
well its not like its just him now either
and honestly, the fact that so many white people have failed to see the real issue at hand and are more concerned about a piece of cloth is not a good sign
like i argued about this with my dad last night
and he literally could not see past its disrespectful
john we just having a discussion
i don't see it that way personally. he's protesting the flag because he believes black people are not being treated fairly under the values the flag stands for. and like i said earlier, people less affected by oppression because of their status have a bigger obligation to combat racism etc because of their privilege
well that's the focus, police brutality. the values of our nation do not condone police brutality
of course it doesn't only apply to black people he thinks black people are disproportionately affected by police brutality. you could draw some parallelisms about the response to Black Lives Matter  from your argument there. BLM started because its founders felt that black people weren't valued as highly as white people. they never said white lives didnt matter. but then white people said, but what about white lives and the point of BLM got twisted into this idea that Only Black Lives Matter, hence stuff like All Lives Matter, Blue Lives Matter, etc
that's a good point, and frankly i dont have the stats to argue against anything rn. i agree the police force is corrupt, and i wish the center of discussion surrounding all of this was closer to that topic
i think the internet has fueled that to a degree
just gonna find me a dem soc gf
lul
yeah I know what you mean


god
yeah ive been using adobe too
fuckkkk the dnd handbook is 30
which btw i still owe u 30 brannon

Like an actual building
There's a building going up
No idea what it be
I know what your talking about tho
I saw that fresh pavement
kek
Parking deck
If they only get the third level, that level will be full all the time
They could do that a lot campuses have
No freshmen who don't commute can have a vehicle on campus
That would help
CU during nonschool year hours is a sacred place
So calm
Just one guy in a booth playing hearthstone
MacBook guy
Yeah
Grow bitter by the time I'm 30

I worked with a 30 year old dude at bell who had been there for 10 years

Don't think she's on rmp
exmillikes to hear himself talk
the type
honestly it'll kinda suck the first time august rolls around and I don't have school to go back to
which should he next summer if things go according to plan
parsons is defense.
I have a defense sector job
It's just not for me
Especially prototyping shit.
It drives me nuts.
if you got a gig at parsons you'd be doing the stuff I do of supporting MDA.
Or
they came to Huntsville to get into defense contracting
They're more of an environmental and industrial engineering company tho.
I want to work for an actual software company
instead of like an engineering firm
lmao
At parsons they got me prototyping shit
no doc
literally just write the shit
yeah like we have a client for this thing I'm working on
But I didn't hear from him till 2 weeks ago and changed shit 3 times in a week after we finally talked to him
kek
Ima just work retail

LOL
max edge
I've started to become an EDC buffoon
fountain pen
knife
I've got a tiny Bluetooth topre keyboard I'm leaving in my bag this semester
and I got my nice hand spinner but I leave that at work
lmao
me never actually goes anywhere
true
need
I'd sling it across my back
and use it when I scream I have the power of god and anime on my side
tee bee ache
i'm a little ready for school to start
I think not being in multiple 100level classes will be nice
We got 487 and 465 together right
What's the rest of your tuesdays/Thursday's look like
we can figure out carpoolin
I have like a 3 hour block between those two classes
2 hour
I might just hang there or go to the library in between then
you got some fuckin days on Monday and Wednesday lol



It's gonna be weird not having a 910 class
yeah this is a pretty dope schedule tho
it's all bc of the online tech writing class
im pretty sure this is the very first semester I haven't had a 910 MWF tho
who else is in there with you
aw shit
if u nervous and your schedule would work, you could pretty easily buss up in 281 with me
take it as an elective or something
but I think you'll be fine in 385
281 is babby stats
elementary stats, basically the intro to 385
your 385 prof What's his name
Terri's class has one spot open if you wanna take her
well
you'd have to BUST ass to Shelby
20 mins
nah wait
I was looking at my schedule lol
you gots conflict
281 open af tho. 3 spots. so if you sense Bad Shit the first few days of 385 that would be a way out. I think it would work if you took it as a gen elective, then held 385 off till next semester
I hate theory
fuck that guy
I need HAND HOLDING
Let me check out my dude
it was staff till recently
lmao
no reviews kms
not even in the database
I think his first semester was in the spring
guess we'll see what it do
yeah he taught the Statistics department version of 281
I didn't even know that was a thing
Bet I know who it was
If it's the dude who sits at the front desk at the police department
Unless they've changed it, yeah I'm pretty sure
Since you always go to the police station to get permits and deal with parking issues
ew
great

Let me find mine

its small
and fuckin sharp
my project manager saw me with once and was like that's a cute knife. then he cut himself with it. kek
oh HOLD UP
it's not 45
my dad bought a 2pack for like 30
they must be discontinued or something
tbh i want a leatherman
not one of the crazy ones
my biggest gripe with the one i have is that it's started to wear. it's got a black finish. it wears kinda neat tho
it is
i don't use mine too much so it stays sharp
usually just to open packages or cut stuff occasionally

hoenstly it weathers pretty cool'
just reveals the steel underneath
seems like sog has a thing for knives that look like they're gonna kill you

the foundation for the game is there and it's really solid already

I will do my best to protect LGBTQ Americans
You can't serve in the military kek
There's already openly trans people in the military
Idk what's gonna happen to them
Sounds edgy
Almost like an antipattern
ew
Sounds like you're asking for unreadable code
Well you're supposed to program around an interface, but if you abstract everything a million times I would think that defeats the purpose
that shit sucks
But I'm dealing with the opposite problem LOL
I ain't touched an object in almost a year
I'm tired of it
It was cool for awhile
Ben moves to chinaBen, 3 weeks later hey I moved to china
congrats Ben
sick ring
maximum shits potential, that's the way Brannon likes it
Humus
Never had any from there but they might have Rocket Republic IPA which I tried at Connor's and liked a lot
fuck
I gotta pirate my books
Every micro require a USB cable, then add the GPS unit, the programmer, and the Logic analyzer, I have like 6 USBs on my computer. It's fucked with my mouse before lol
yeah that's pretty sick, that's where I would want be I think
It was pretty cool to take that ARM class last semester and then end up using it this summer
Just by chance
Yeah, we do all defensive stuff. No weapons tho
If they ever ask me to work on something that kills people, I'll leave
Seems like my project manager has been focused on explosives neutralization and geographic analysis with drones and shit
The Zeus laser system literally targets and destroys explosives in war environment
That's what my coworker is working on
I'm jealous
He's converting it to ARM
It shoots a beam at the explosive that makes it combust or something

if you doing work on a Friday you lame
a basic bitch
she asked me for 424 and 413 books the other day I should reply lol
I have one of them in PDF
And I'll let her use the other
I let her borrow my book for cal b
Yeah I meant like, a semester or two ago
lol

I heard
No more memes

I'm getting my hair cut
Did I tell y'all I keep it kinda short now
I look like a racist from the 50's rn
he's actually
That's kinda what my hair looks like lmfao
nice

ffs
uhhhhh
i should definitely have weight
my system isn't that skewed

im gonan have to start a collection again
if it doesnt show ratings
idk maybe my profile is all fucked up
im checking out cinemos
im not feeling the little circle things
it's not as easy to see the rating
oh you know what
i think the parts where it's darker are hotspots for ratings
so you can kinda make out the avg rating just by looking at the circle
i could be wrong

its been pinned
its the prayer of the evening
next week for me
ain't this yer last day
look at y'all, doing actual software shit. Parsons is pissing me off lately. The just fucking write the code we'll fix it later prototype environment is really starting to wear thin
well it sounds you guys are doing software processes and procedures, no Like code reviews and shit like that
documentation
none with parsons. my coworker is working on this 20 year system that has loads of documentation on it, but my things is a new project and it really has just been write it as fast as possible. And it's changed like 3 times in the past week. Its getting fucking annoying
I wanna get back to a real software dev environment tbh
I guess with embedded prototyping they just don't care about processes, they just want the code written. I don't think it's really for me honestly
that's kinda how some of my structures feel
Nice, that sounds pretty cool
I have this embedded system with 3 micro controllers
we have this thing called magnetometer that detects mines in the ground
And we're gonna hang it from a drone
Anyway, the situation right now is trying to synchronize 2 different microcontrollers to timestamp all the data correctly
And it's been a bitch
They've changed it threes times in the past week
Basically GPS has this thing called 1 pulse per second that's just a precise pulse each second, and we gotta send that down to the payload micro, and then sync it up with a timer to keep our clocks from drifting
it's hurting my head lol
cuz the micro on the bottom is getting data from two devices, and the one up top is getting data from the payload, the mag, and a GPS unit, and since propagation delay is a thing, the data on the SD card would be kinda timestamped incorrectly if you just did it without keeping them synced
that's my rant
been bugging the shit out of me lol
It is cool, I guess it's just unfamiliar territory and I wish there was more structure
it'll be good experience in the end
look good on a resume, gives you some flexibility, that kinda shit
parsons has pretty much told me they want to make me a hardware/software guy lmao
ill definitely know how to fuck around with arduinos now lmfao
OH SHIT
do we sign up
i'm in
do you get an error report when you try to look at your profile
well, i was thinking the same but i changed profiles months ago
it said july 11, 2017
try going onto mine from yours
i can get toyours
same thing from yours
weird


this is pretty dope
the bio needs to be above it tho
i can visit other profiles
but not my own
wtf
im jake
there
looks like the circle thing is a rating deppiction brannon
the circles you posted earlier
really wish i could look at my own fuckin profile lol
Narga's doesnt work either
ourbreaks does
nicole's doesn't
huh
that's weird
must be a bug
hol up boy
our subs start
i fuckin hope not
like it says subscriber
but it gives an expr date too
and it started a week ago LOL
oh it says it will be adjusted
yeah mine was fuckin december
we've waited so fuckin long lmao
im fairly happy with this so far
the features look promising
custom rating systems
did you see that

holy shit
my music ratings have zero weight
oh i think i need to request
i guess it did it automatically
in rym
i barely meet the threshold for weighted ratings
oh i can see my profile now
nice
yeha ill see if they actually approve the request
personally i think you if you cannot have more than 7 offers on the table your table is not strong enough

yup just heard
john
c'mon
I mean linkin park sux but I listened to them everyday when I was a kid
That dude killin himself is sad
apparently
I didn't know either
disgusting
i want a cloak

i kinda like this
cloaklike

WAAAAH I CANT WEAR COPPER CHARGED SANDALS
you disgust me
but overwatch
lol the bot should have a flawless victory counter

cucked by audio
I just spent thutty neet bux on apple earphones so my sound generator will sound the same when I sleep lul
Even though I bought SE215s yesterday
that said, i just did some comparisons
it's definitely a big step up
way more clear and balanced
honestly tho apple earphones don't suck
still overpriced
but not awful
next thing you know john gonna think he has rabies
/flip
why is there an unflip
but no flip

really
its table flip
someone make a repo for a python bot
we can all work on it
BadBot

i figured its the best language to use for this type of thing
what's ark's bot written in
or did he use one with an api
nice
well, that'll explain it
yeah lmao

she dead

Would you take the job
we out here now
the only rule
we can use bots again
i will make a bot that can repost memes to the meme database
with a command like add username
that grabs the last image the user posted
i was talkin bout dnd
what other channels
do we invite sierra and austin or keep it the people in imessage
we can plead with them perhaps
actually sierra hasn't heard from austin lol
i talked toher a few days ago
his mom can't even get a hold of him
ill just keep it the imessage for now
the bois
i need to add pepe emojis
lemme figure out how to
staffed
now dont go deleting the server you fucks
oh yeah oops, i thought that didnt save
bruh metal sounds so much better with these new phones
most stuff sounded like a shitty wall of noise before
the shitty wall of noise it was intended to sound like, at least
ill let the meme database channel name getting changed slide
for the sake of less underscores
nope
just tried
mane i don't think it's real

popular minimalism is centered around buying things


this is brannon when he's at work 3 hours before the building opens

please watch this

lmfao



lmfao
i think it's more of a lil b type thing
everything is a statement signed by lil b


dual function

or do they expire
yeah i lost a shit ton of mine

weems just talks louder when she wants to sound like she knows her shit
oh my god i forgot she was in birdman
are we going to red robin or what
also  come
oh yeah i figured after the movie
i'm gonna skip on the movie but wanna have dinner with you guys
you guys want ered robin now
i can leave in a few
i'm leaving now
just pulled into red robin
are you guys here
i'm in my car, let me know when you park
actually i'll go get us a table
i got us one
by the kitchen
yo, did you use any other libraries for your discord bot other than discord.py
i'm potentially making an ambient/drone server and just got a bot going for it
how did yall come out gpa wise
well that's lame
and taking forever
oh i'm positive you all graduated
should be just fine
a couple points loss, at the very most
i'm currently trying to enroll for summer classes
trying to get back into school
idk if i told yall but if all goes right i can graduate in spring of 2019
so how does it feel
to be like
officially done
my request for retroactive withdrarwal actually got approved
i'm so relieved
that puts my gpa in a much better place
the cool thing about this is
it might mean i can get some more out of my scholarship
idk
the scholarship lady at uah is out on maternity leave
i won't hear back till june 4th
idk if withdrawing from a full year means i can get my scholarship back
but it's worth it to find out
3.02 gpa
thanks man
and CoS just made asses of themselves on twitter about it
CoS is dumb as shit
well
the argument is institutional
blacks in america are disproportionately convinced
that's the argument
you's keepin more black people out by having that policy, that's what leftist twitter was going off about i think
CoS argument was that
if u make the decision to be convinced you've acted against their tenements
self worship etc
convicted
tbh i think any organization associated with satanism as an actual religion are kinda scammy
CoS gives the religion a bad name
my friend is a satanist but they don't like CoS
i don't even think they like ToS
yeah i knew some pagan ppl in high school
can i okay video games during
play
lmao
i never tried cuz i know i couldn't do it
oof
i couldn't do it
i can't even lay still in bed
caroline and i need a queen
don't turn that down
and make her getchee a tuft and needle memory foam one
i snore as i'm falling asleep
then it goes away
but it's bad at first
i told them that
in the forgone
groupme
yeah LOL
wtf
yeah i told me i was dropping out for personal reasons and apologized
em
how long ago was this
i told them back in like february
OH
yeah
that makes sense
i thought they mentioned me during the last presentation
yeah i was basically trying to not kill myself back then so i wasn't sayin jack shit
did i ever tell you guys what caused all this
it was my medicine
it was completely fucking me up
and it happened so gradually i thought it was a natural decline and didn't think it was my medicine
i just don't want y'all to think i was being lazy
i feel way better now
caroline is on vyvanse
try the adderall for a bit
if it helps you can get your own prescription
once i figure out what medicine works best for my mood i'll probably want some kind of focus shit too
rn i'm on trintellix, ability, and lemictal
i've never been in this much before
it's weird
my mood real fuckin stable now tho
my mom is like that
but she also takes fucking xanax
so
oh yeah
i'm hoping to get back on just two, they want to cut trintellix out
being on as much shit as marissa is would freak me out
i don't want to be over medicated lol
medicine can help a fuckin lot
the answer to long term healing is counseling and shit but god damn man, the medicine is what got me on my feet again
yeah
lmao
that mentality of like
god did this
has always bothered me a shit ton lol
yeah
just strikes me as crazy when people do it
w/e i guess, without god half of america or more would be kms
same
i just say i'm nonreligious or agnostic is people implore
if
lol did y'all see where the church of satan was like we do not accept convinced felons into the church of satan
and everyone, rightly
was like
uh that's racist and also stupid
congratulations
you've passed
brannon opens the dorm door

they probably pulled something out of their asses
but that kinda stuff stresses me out
yeah
the beanie guy probably did it all himself tbh
the way that team worked was

i got the email about uah
glad my psych appointment is at 1
i almost got cucked by nature
yeah traffic gonna be wild
were talking about rupauls drag race up there
wasn't he catching some shit a couple days ago for some reason
you ever care about profit so much you automate and restrict your customers refills
well i'm not sayin it affects me
it just seems stupid considering a soft drink costs bout 4 cents to make
so even if someone sat in the cu all day using the same cup, they'd make profit still
have you guys heard of computers

look at this dumb ass math question caroline has for business math
this might be the stupidest question i've ever seen

this makes the software boi in my tingle
yall ever looked at Sass
it basically lets you write CSS more akin to an actual programming language
with functions, lists, variables, etc
it converts what you write into a usable css file
it even supports default arguments
the uah don't give a shit
the employees at real chick fil as would shoot them selves if you asked them to
yall ever notice
how uah spends a shit ton of money on something
then does no upkeep on it
so after a year or two it looks like ass
unless it's the faculty palace
i've started feeling so unproductive i've been doing codecademy shit
html and css
i've actually learned a good deal
y'all ever heard of documentation specialist
basically you manage a company's internal documentation, manuals, etc
it's like extremely light database work
anyway i found a job opening for one in town and it seems like i might have a shot
they wanted an associate's degree or two years prior related experience, and i'm wondering how flexible that is
i'm gonna stop working there  yeah
i haven't talked to them yet but i was hired as an intern so if i'm out of school i can't work there
it was kind of coming to that anyway, i was extremely burned out there
i had decided to go somewhere else once i graduated
embedded/engineering type stuff isn't for me
where y'all at
i thought today was the 6th so i came out four counseling but it's the 5th actually
fuck morton
anyone wanna come get wow

well i haven't told them anything so he was assuming
butyeah
i need to let them know what's up
tf
well
maybe im uh dodging a bullet here
even from the start, everything was like, kind of a mess. zero communication, so that's why i havent been rushed to give them any
peer reviews
how is it
working in software

it's not so much the content itself as it is the style it's written that drives me up a wall
all i remember is it was new testament
then i guess it was included it was some pocket bible
if i had to guess
it was NKJV
you ever base your religion off the needless suffering and murder of millions
speak clearly boy

religion
my new religion is blockchain
when do you think uah will start teaching blockchain classes
hey give them some credit
they have one shitty cloud computing class
need dat remote accessibility
it's one server that's white and shaped like a cloud
blockchain is the new cloud
except now it can be exploited to make ponzischemes and minute billionaires
jeff bezos invented the cloud
when is jeff bezos gonna buy craigslist
i only ever read genesis
when i was a kid
it's written like shit
i ate food a couple times
me.jpg
i skripped math but i now i gotta take my mom to the clinic so i'm gonna miss OS
kms
aight
you ever use a meme from 2012
i'm killing myself
i'm killing myself
i am killing myself

holy shit
i'm despondent
product owner kek
ego
there's just one more after this right
this is the normiest team
the put the NEETs on the left side
talking guy imagine looking in the mirror and deciding that's how you should wear your facial hair
it's like a U on your chin

oh my god she just cringed
did y'all see that
i still have no idea who the fuck she is
i'm upset
i'm gonna drop out and do data entry

i'm not talking to anyone anymore
if this is what i have to deal with in software dev
i can type fast enough
i'd be wasting my skills doing software dev
she's talking to ethan
in her head
who gonna let me enter data for them
he unlearned how to practice basic hygiene just like fenriz unlearned how to play drums
the guy talking is at least marginally normal
i mean

what's going on with that one dude in brannon's group
y'all know which one
it's like his hair just grows and then mushrooms when it decides to
brannon uses discord to not take a side and harbor lite white nationalism
i left the crypt to perhaps not hear about goregrind ever again
rekt
the haircut gives him powers
imagine what having dina in your group for this class would be like
i'm suicidal
LOL
REKT
yo that guy's been losing weight
that's him right
they guy who always needed the table in CS classrooms
i could put two of those guys in a coma with my fists and feel no remorse
the guy who always wore the really baggy khakis

they look a lot alike
how much lean do you think it would take to hospitalize him
take that and double it for momo

coleman shows you a gun under his desk when he asks a question
or gives advice
what about weast
machineGun.firestudent
Qitong is trying his best
i remember in speech
he would like
rock back and forth

cuz we gotta show its a scalar basically
Prove that if d I a then d I ca for any integer c .
maybe im thinking too deep into it
i guess for this one
the NTS is

oof this one is a bit tricky
all we know is that dm  a

aight
idk which attack im gonna do yet
man in the middle maybe
mane i explained ARP poisoning in half a page
you must have been more wordy
what fint dize
font size
true, i dont have a title or header or anything
i looked at the sample assignment
i'm fuqd
for this test
what did you think of it
meh
will miss some points
but i had it putting circles on the screen in the diff colors, making them disappear after 5 secs or if clicked, and counting correct and incorrect taps internally
but i ran out of time for the banner at the top
and green circles stayed the full 5 seconds
so idk
im feeling a 75ish for that much
here's my code from the 371 midterm if you want to compare it with yours

i probably did some things pretty inefficiently but i was under pressure lmao
oh acutally yeah i fucked up
my decideIfGreen function makes no sense the way I used it
oops
what did you use to make your user help manual
you ever give a pop quiz one class after a midterm
oh okay
that makes sense
i just figured it meant like
no two devices can be sending packets to the same port in the same direction
but i could be wrong
maybe it me
i use this sweet smelling axe
i came here for the review
reeeee
i just saw localhost and thought it said holocaust
i should have stayed in bed
it's an option
what we gonna miss Him breathing too loudly and sweating
what's your take
same with me
oh nice
its gon be late
mane i aint know
thats uh
on the todo list

should each image sheet have its own file
or are those sequences
i got on the waitlist for 490 with mary allen
wei li had spots open
should i just take him
me too mane
is it just me or does tech hall feel muggy today
maybe it's just the weather in general
the diff between a hub and s switch is that a hub just forwards the frame to all addresses hooked up to it ye
and switches only do data to the correct mac addr, if theres a mac in the table
yeah
im just going through it
josh dont fuck around
huge study guide... in a text file
yeah
i hope we get some mult choice at least
Can you have more than one MAC address associated with a single port
no, right
1 port1 physical device
maybe that's what he meant
nope
i aint
but
it looks like you're puttin the sprites together
it doesn't look too wild
i turned it in
my stomach went DDSADD like 10 mins before i was gonna leave
yall wanna hang out at tecc tonight
you're trying to find all the IPs on the network yeah
or something like that
im pulling up the addignment rn
so we're finding info about all of uah's machines
in that range
yall used nmap right
im guessing nmap is just a linux program
ah okay
ill do that tonight den
what does he mean by banners
could just  everything to a text file lol
ah yeah
what did you guys make on the first lab
i got two point taken off for something
wonder what i missed
unless there's feedback somewhere im not finding
for lab 2
i started with
nmap v 10.1.1.0/24
holy shit thats a lot of fuckin ports
i only found 2 hosts though
does that line up with what yall got
yeah, i got
10.1.1.6410.1.1.117
UDP scan maybe
lemme try it
i, like a dumbass, did a A search to get shits on the two i found
why the fuck is hercules running windows 98
it looks like 117 is to running it as well
oh nevermind
it sayd the OS is server 2012
yeah seems that way
i think i fucked up
UDP scan been going for like
7 mins
reeee
ya this shit is taking ages
over 10 mins now
i cant even ctrlc out of it
i made it way fucking faster
nmap sU minrate 5000 10.1.1.0/24
took like one second
3 hosts
yeah it found 50
so did you guys just say the OS is Windows
it says the fingerprint is too many possible mathces
did you guys get banners and shit
idk what else to really do from here looking at man
doesnt seem like anything would be beneficial
lmao is trump gonna be here
great
fake news
twitter is a more reliable source of news than news
me

I'm going to the dungeon if y'all wanna hang out for a minute after the test
nvm someone came an hour early
i fucking Hate engineers
i aint do too good

why am i in mobile computing
why did i do this
i need to finish my app still
reeeeeeeeeee
yeah
go play runescape
nah fr though im slipping lately
having the same issues with doing things like last semester. idk what it is, its not laziness
idk justin
i uninstalled overwatch and shit
im taking a break
and trying to fix my sleeping
jedda holy shit
wait
nah nvm
there's a z in his native language right
anyone wanna hang at tecc tonight everyone
no
what you want me to do terms on
if youre doing the intro stuff and brannon is doing the er stuff, i guess that only leaves the relational alg/cal stuff
not really any progress since last night
i made a grid of 9 squares with the zone on top and invisible but thats it
each square needs an event listener right

how do you set the even listener
like
oh
does it have some member that you set equal to a function
to handle a click
sweet
thanks
i wonder if im wasting my time using the zone
you said youre not doing anything with it
just the zone
not the handler
weird
i assumed it was used to sense a click in a certain part of the gameboard
idk how to do the label without the widget
i have not
this would be fine if we didnt have to make it look good
we could maybe use that site we used for the infographics
ima have to turn it in late
like everything else in this class cuz im a dumb ass
speaking of dumb ass bullshit
ima go get taco bell
anyone wanna come
i think i shall

disgusting
i need to get more sleep
i keeps sayin
ill get up earlier and go to sandellas
but i never get out of bed
i have 60 meals left
i aint been but 9 times this semester
how you gonna be Taco Bell and be out of rice at the same time
mans in front of me smells like old cheese
and i cant see
couldnt thom just send this to us
tfw you spend 10 mins awkwardly writing this shit on the board in an incoherent manner
when you could just upload the sheet on canvas
thom works at adtran
apparently he's also a writer
yo brakes squeaky Branny
Brannon BOLTED
Christian server ripped Winnie the pooh
you made any progress on your tic tac toe game
im looking at the code he gave us
how'd you go about making the grid i figured there was a line function but it seems thats not true
did you make 9 smaller boxes
inside that zone variable
he has some variable called zone
yeah
i resized it to 250x250
the assignment says
the values he has are incorrect
and he has it set to a sensor
so i figured thats the actual gameboard
hm
yeah
you prob gotta make em global
and group them
im thinking if you group them inside zone you should be good to go
idk this seems weird
the slides say you make a new group by doing
newGroup
im having trouble understanding how to position the swuares based on the zone
justin 5 weeks later me too
how did you arrange them
like to resemble a grid
are you using the zone object at all
the zone is the original rectangle i thought
unless im missing something, i cant find a whole lot about how groups actually work in the slides
basically i want to group the zone and 9 individual squares into one
with the zone on top but invisible
cuz its a sensor
damn he was HUFFIN
aint ol boy know when you fat you sposed to wear an undershirt with a button down
drop out
then go shit
right in front of the projector
i shit bout once per day these days fellas
does thom know how to set this up
why we gotta make a second one
gg
kill urself
how tf do you copy text from a Putty window
found it
let me know what we do in 465
my phone died on me last night and i slept through my alarm clock
i aint gon make it

After much debate and fierce controversy throughout the scientific establishment, scientists used an accurate scientific song quality scale in an experiment to generate and record measurements to empirically determine that Taylor Swifts song Look What You Made Me Do is terrible.
this what i did for the first paramedic one
fucc

prayer gets you good grades

/
im just gonna
if yalls is down for it

i used C
oh shit
i did the wrong one
kms
wew
these are a little easier to understand though i guess
fuck
this is TRASH
does anyone wanna go to subway for dinner tonight

i cant get my head around joins
but i think thats what you gotta do for the first problem
am i missing something or are the slides missing half the relation tables
from lecture 2
maybe its just a natural join

hmm
i wonder why in the example they used clientNo on both sides
we're in the second antechamber brannon
for when you get out of class
4 gonna make me commit suicide
Pr is the aggregate function
oh yeah
true
yeah so we do Pr to generate the table that has all the data we need i think
and then do a selection of all rows where myCount  0
ah yeah so we need it then
idk im still not 100 sure this is right but i feel better about it
inb4 completely wrong, 0 credit received
im not sure
i dont think so
you have to specify it in Pr
i think it would cuz it wants you to show all cities
487gonna makes my brainz hurt
i bullshitted that job ad worksheet

My 281 teacher sounds like he might die
And he doesn't know how to use a flash drive
great
no
He sounds like a good 'ol boy from Alabama
5 minutes before the first class and he already shit on left leaning politics kek
we know from history what happens when you try to be democratic
good 'ol boy from Alabama confirmed
lmao  this teacher
wew
this gon' be good
good god
lmao
did you see where they cut off the road between Morton and franz
makes sense I suppose
ew
I'm hanging at cu till like 350 I'd anyone wants to come hang
I'm gettin dunkin
I just saw a /pol/ dweller irl
He had a make America dank again shirt on
It's approximately busy as fuck at CU
AND there's a school shooter
all black
pants, long sleeve shirt
playing his 3ds
Someone please come see
Here
nice
I'll find somewhere to sit
not study rooms
I'm gon vomit it's too busy
Hey many people did they accept this year
Lmao
freshmans
Their orientation counselors kept them away from tech hall
It's miserable outside
I have 3 pairs and one is ripped
I think my game plan on MW is to get to CU at 9 and find a fuckin study room
too many normies
yeah it's called burrito bowl or something
I got a table by a pillar
nice
ww still chillin at elem thutty
cs klub boys
i mean
it's like playing a 3ds in public
same concept i guess
arent there only like a few games for it anyway
which room
ive actually forgotten all the weirdos
oh yeah
the dude who get there by like 8
inb4 dies of cancer
we're talking like
the teacher
that's what ive heard too
Sierra says parking by the uc is awful
you can right now
parking is t enforced
Isn't
don't even bother driving through the the uc parking lot
I went straight to north
found one
just end my life
that's ok
anywhere is fine
well
gg
DELLI'S ON THURSDAY IS A NO GO LADS
I gotta get my shit ready for school
2.5 weeks boys.
They gonna help you pay for it
yeah me too
this is a pretty good release
it's got loops that kinda remind of a hybrid between Forming and The Caretaker
or anyone for that matter
this is a good as album

Sonemic is 90 complete
i think it might. theyre going full dev cycle with it, which is good
hmmmm
can you try .np
i think i know whats up but i want to be sure
regardless, reminder that this demo kicks ass.
i'm at the tables in CU if you want to hang out before class
i think when i changed my name it fucked up
and i can't just add a new entry because networkdrift already has a key
oh dope
nvm then
the .np function will always work, it just won't have album art info
i'm using plex so no live scrobbling
i'm listening to topiary
NEW CULT LEADER

single is pretty mathy and crusty
vocal delivery is really death metal influenced
like you know how he had a pretty guttural tone already. he ramped it up
my friend preordered it for me
did you listen to it
yeah
they tagged it as progressive crust lol
listening to this through IEMs is definitely a different experience than in the car
they're more technical than before
damn
yeah i bought a new pair of the shures
i use the little pouch they come with now
they've held up pretty well
do it
so worth
get dat black color

i ordered these
my coworkers made fun of me cuz i could never hear them with the IEMs
they'd say my name like 5 times and eventually have to tap me
nice
yeah not being hear distractions goes a long way
sometimes i wish i had my own office
so if someone came in i'd just see them
oh that's sick dude
i need to do something like that

that line about chowder is one of the best lines on the album
aside from 8 years in the game i never rode a wavei may be overlooked but i'm never underpaid
and the hype man fuckin goes off on sumo lmao
my problem with the album is that there's some fucking great stuff in it but it feels inconsistent and overall pretty average
lmao
i've never bothered with him
sound like durr durr durr, you like oh thats lit
have you listened to the new portrayal of guilt song
i just
listened to a playboi carti song for the first time
that was the worst shit i ever heard
what a dumbass
yeah
i think the new thou leaked

sonemic might finally be getting there
i wonder what pedal arnaut pavle used for the ep

yeah, its a good one
i listen to it still too
i cant stop listening to Sumo
its become my favorite song on the album
no its not
but i think a lot of that stuff is produced by 2047 under a million monikers
what the
i had no idea
in fact i thought dmt was dead
i bought the discography when there was like 200 releases or something
well shit
lmao
i mean hed have to output more than like 3 a day to get 1000
is it standard vapor wave stuff still
future funk
or has he changed
i think hke put out something on there
i cant remember if that one release i love is on dmt
by dark nature
oh its on bloody carpet
i remember dmt stuff found pretty samey
i think blcr is a little higher quality
ha
cool project
theres this one release on there i liked till i found it was literally just a redone blade runner theme
2047 ofc
hes known for ripping shit off
he is also dark nature and i have a feeling that one album i like so much was ripped off
but i cant figure out from where
so idk
its called something earth
maybe end of earth or something
iirc you liked it as well
did you ever listen to calvaiire
just met someone who likes Deathwish
okay nice
i listen clout cobain
its kinda trash
eh
denzel being denzel
i guess he wanted to emphasize on the three acts
ill have to catch up today
ive heard sumo, clout cobain, and percs obviously
welcome to the darkest side of taboo
weird he put sumo on the first act
i'm a bit disappointed he's throwing around some misogyny in his lyrics here after shitting on the rest of industry for doing so in percs
seems like sumo shoulda been on act 2 and sirens on act 1
weird he did that
ha
that's fucking cute
what's the guy's name
you should put it on rym lol
i like the continuation from black balloons to the blackest balloon
that's really good thematic shit
oh it leaked
wow lmao
when you gon listen
fuck 12
dude's real
i think he fucked up and put the insta icon twice lol
aw shit
oof
jpefmafia is on this denzel release
i don't like him
not cuz he's bad at what he does
but cuz he's an ass
they're super cool
yeah
i found this denzel release decent on first run
the highlight is totally percs though
LNFAO
holy shit
you ever head of these guys

its the same formula as orange mathematics
not bad at all, just nothing new
have you listened to the new denzel curry in full yet
portrayal of guilt got a full length coming out apparently
can't fuckin' wait

what do you guys think of this
POCKETS TOO BIG THEY SUMO
PULL A NI'S CARD LIKE UNO
looks good
i've just been shilling baptists

and when i think of himabove her battered selfmy modes of coping failand turn to fists from hell
ao aggro lol
baptists' new album is decent
victim service and a couple other tracks are great
i'll check it all out
i'll use my bandcamp script to download it jut for fun
did you ever check that script out
i'm a bit proud of it
it's over in coding
it grabs info about all the track and then grabs the stream urls and downloads everything
i got it tagging the files last night too
i think that version takes command line argument only
it's not REALLY that useful with soulseek and stuff but i just did it to prove i could
oh 128
that's what you stream from bandcamp
if you've purchased the music i think it stream in v0 quality
so you could theroretically grab those but you've bought it already so what's the point
it was just a fun a project my mind got stuck on that i had to finish
i used mutagen to tag stuff

here's the most recent i think version if you want to fuck around with it
hoo gonna tell rym deafheaven doesnt have screamo influence
lol
yeah
overhyped nonsense
i feel like deafheaven gets special treatment
ima change that command to fm
how does it feel to have a screenshot
i might be able to do that but as its nickname idk if it will work
he changes his name all the time
it was kharklim 3 hours ago

ostraca just up and released a new album
new album
the comment box for the new deafheaven is absolutely hilarious
like
ive seen some bad, overhyped shit before
but this is on its own level
the new birds in row is super good dude
i was real worried about it
but it was good from listen one and it keeps getting better
it leaked in 128k a couple days ago

i just realized my receiver is sitting right behind me now so i can listen to records at night with my headphones
primitive man had a new split coming out
oh shit
brannon have you listened to conjurer's most recent release
already givin me a boner
i herd about conjurer through cult leaders run page
theyre more of an atmo sludge band but they definitely have taken some influence from gaza/cult leader
its like if The Mire collabd with cult leader or something

something tells me this gon' slap
you might like these dudes too
yeah the singles on this are mega intense

did you see this
well
i like those days at work
you can just do your own thing
damn
uh oh
oi always forget to cast my types lol
i think it's working
that's a lil better
just some flavor
gonna amke it so that if you only roll 1d it says die
i hate it when it does this
two bo ts start running at the same time
sorry for spam lol
i need to fix the .np command
oh i think i konw what's up
if the album isn't registered, it throws an error
damn that sucks

another good little release
it's been in my wishlist for awhile now
oh nice
lmao
the bot has a new feature
right now only works if your last fm name is registered, but since yours is it will work just fine
yall stay sleeping on my contributions to this bot
this release really is great
unsurprsingly, the new deafheaen sucks ass
i'd give sunbaher and new bermuda 3s or 3.5s on a really good day, the new one comin in at a 2
it's hardly even blackgaze, it's mostly a shoegaze album with harsh vocals
no bite
idk dude, maybe i need to give it another go with a different lens
it's just tough to hear them weaken their sound like that
people shit on new bermuda but it has some of their better, more aggro riffs
luna's opener is sick
i've grown out of it
i enjoy new bermuda and sunbather for the nostalgia
but it aint something i can listen to much anymore
i wish they'd written sunbather now, it would be a stronger album
this new one is more coehsive in sound and theme
for me
it sounds like shoegaze with harsh vocals, not blackgaze
that's the key difference
idk. i think specifically of deafheaven when i hear the term blackgaze
this one is more shoegaze and post rock, i hear very little black influence at all
like i'm listening to new bermuda now for fun
and it hast that signature bite
the production on the new one don't do it no favors
it's really slick and shiny
good idea,  guess i'm going in reverse order
oof i ain't heard much health, cept for that one fucking BANGER from that game soundtrack
tears i believe it's called
max payne 3 ost

so wheres emoviolence
ohhh i bet i'm not scrobbling
bot's broke

no idea why .np is busted
i still think this album is great
id be down
i can contribute with all the weird vapour and ambient shit i know
if you make it today i can probably start adding some stuff when i get to the dungeon
lmao
why not the library today
wow
that's uh
pretty bad
like what is the point
i'
m
adding some stuff
there's some ambient shit that i found pretty dystopic that it more subjective
i can add em and if you don't agree feel free to take them down
that little topiary release i just added is pretty good though
industrial/ambient type deal
what games are you downloading by the way
this song is great
wtf
yeah never heard of that
sounds interesting though
yeah
i'm glad they added it back
i wish sonemic would just come out already
it's been too long to justify waiting for a perfect release
well
i'll take it i guess
honestly they could just keep adding new features to rym
it's not like anyone really wanted a new site to begin with
the kickstarter was successful because people thought it would be done int ime
listening now
need some usic to code to
i found something kinda like this yesterday
ill link it after i listen

here it is if you wanna listen
this first track is fucking sick
and that's dope
i don't have the fortitude to work that long each day
tbh
my productivity just plummets after 2pm, even on a good day
sometimes if i really got in a groove i could make it to 530 or 6
my dream would be 6 hour work days
but it's never gonna happen in america
oh you are man
i figured that one out about softmore year
i think i am too, tbh
lol
i really just aid 'softmore
when i got really motivated our sophomore years i could wake up at 7 and roll into cu by 830
but i was trying really hard
i stuck to 8 am starts at parsons
750, tops
lol
man i really miss that first summer at parsons
i was doing stuff i wanted to be doing
i'm really hoping this opportunity with Oasys pans out
idk if i showed you guys the website
but they're not like missile defense stuff for a change

their website is kind of terrible
but they do a lot of data processing
datat storage, warehousing, etc
it seems pretty cool
their HR guy said i'd be working in C
which i'm okay with
I said I have experience in Java and i think a good deal of that would translate into C, with some help
slowly but surely
if i can get through this last school year man
the senior project will be pretty cool
hoping i get a more cohesive team than last time. i mean i can'
t
say much since i quit on them
and they put something together
i just didn't mesh with the people much
beanie guy probably made it look nice
the guy knows his stuff

really well produced beat tape
this is a super good album
i need to add the album name to the card
working on it now
might be able to make the thumbnail a bit bigger that way too
hmmmm
whatcha think
gotcha
research park type deal
wow lol
i'd prefer to work downtown tbh
looking out at raytheon when i'm at parsons is... idk man
do you guys want to move closer to downtown eventually
damn
my dad's job in virginia was an hour commute
idk, i could do it for a couple years but i'd get tired of it i think
it's not a dealbreaker though
that's true actually
that's pretty sick
it would save you in the long run
on gas and stuff
ye
that first paycheck is gonna be sweet sweet sweet
that sounds right, i was making about 1200 on 15/hr at parsons
that's sick
that's a lotta money
and the sooner the better
the no rent situation is great though
oh yeah
i couldn't do it more than a year or so
but i'm thinkin,
rent in nashville is what
like
1k a month for a smallish place i'm guessing
idk what cost of living is there
but that's an extra 1k a month you can put towards loans
ah yeah
well, whatever that would be about
can go towards loans, which is a sick deal
yep
i figure it's already higher than huntsville
like a good deal higher
i've always thought i could live in nashville
i think it'd be ok for me. still in the south, close enought o parents, but lively enough to have more fun than in hsv
bands come through there
speaking of, if you wanna see a show i will absofuckinglutely drive up there if it's something i want to see too
i know more bands come through nashville than hsv
like way more
louisville
ah
that's dope
that's my biggest issue with huntsville
you're either drivine an hour and a half to bham or 3 hours to atlanta
2 hours to nashville
that in nashville
i'll come hang if i can, i'd love to see a show there
i like nashville
meh, that works for some people but i just can't do it
if you don't mind my asking that is
salaried or hourly
ah
gotcha
6month trial period i guess
oh okay
if i take this thing with oasys when it opens i'm probably looking at almost a 5/hr paycut
yeah
most of the time that stuff is v cautionary. it's just in case they made some severe misjudgement about how you'dbe as an employee
that's a pretty sweet deal dude. you's getting paid 50k a year at a place that encourage questions, that's good shit
i kinda hate the mentality some employers have that you gotta google everything especially when an expert can explain it hands on a lot faster
i get it
do you think you'll keep the web dev thing going forward in your career
pretty early to ask but
i'm really thinking about going that route too
when i dropped out i got into web dev stuff
it's a good niche to be
i heard react is the big thing rn
like
the big big thing
supa hot
thats'a  good place to start though, c
oh wow
that's ancient dude
you're overhauling that
wow
damn i'm jealous, i'd love to get my hands on something like that
and you gotta overhaul them all i'm guessing
nice
daaaamn i'm jealous
and right now you're working on some of the simpler stuff
CRUD sheets, iirc
oh okay cool
don't fret it, you'll be way more comfortable with the code base and stuff by then
if i had to guess the deadline is internal
yall use git and stuff i'm guessing
ah
yeah
that's sick
this sounds like the perfect job for you dude lol
how's the commute been
or any kind
i gots the stage lights on in the dungeon right now all cozied up
really didn't they say you would
well shit. i guess it's pretty common to have a few people in a room these days
is there a thermostat in there
that blows
it probably gets hot in there just cuz there's three people in there
that's pretty dumb
ah
you got a spot by the window
that's pretty dope
i don't think even my dad has a window rn
jeez
spacious at least
they have like 20 people in there
i'd kinda like that environment, if it was reasonable
bruh that's dope
bring yer keyboard in
lmfao
i've realized
mx browns are about as loud as normal keyboards
although
i want a keyboard for work with silent reds
they're quieter than browns
jeez
we swear all the time at parsons
two sanders supporters and a trump supporter in one room, there's been good times
eh
we got along real well from the get go
i consider ben a friend
the trump supporter
his head's on right enough
and yeah ben and i are the youngest, as of this summer, they hired like 6 new interns this years
and probably justin
i think there are a few things he's unsure about what trump is doing
wow
that's tough
we didn't get any set deadlines at parsons
just kinda like
eh
do this pls
maybe i'm just an underachiever but i kinda just want to do code slinging all my life
just take a well made SDD or whatever it's called and write the code
it sounds like you're an internish person. just entry level, i think that's standard stuff
what'd they start you out for pay
waaaaay better


this guy
is so cringey

good release from hainbach
the guy who did no need for rain
i've been listening to more of his discog and it's pretty damn good
he's a bit underrated
time for some ambient my mans
you ever listen to it
that bitch is dead and im not cryin
he was abusive, misogynistic and homophobic
now that hes dead everyones going awww rip x he was a legend

lmao
this is the same song 50 times
you ever listen to anything other than wound empire by abstracter
aint it

lol
been listening to a lot of rafael anton irisarri
i think he's one of my fasvorite ambient producers to be honest

this is a particularly good album of his
hehe
no idea
i haven't listened to that one in a bit
but i remember it
that's just them i guess
they give zero fucks
i think their most recent album is kinda boundary pushing tbh
correct me if i'm wrong
i saw you listened to caustic by primitive man a few days ago
thats's a good un
i don't think i've gottent o the others
i just really, really like caustic
meh
i like the faster bits in caustic
it adds a lot of character
i didn't connect the dots for awhile but the vocalist is the dude in vermin womb
idk how i didn't realize, he uses the same style in both

if you want some crusty stuff, i recommend this band
bushcraft is pretty good, their newest is good but not as strong
haven't listened to bloodmines yet
they matured some in beacon of faith, but the cool moments imo aren't as common
southern lord is a cool label
i've been directing my focus on ambient stuff though
prowling bandcamp mostly
i listened to basically only ambient stuff at work
i might make a masterlist of my favorite ambient releases sometime soon
i feel like i have enough to do so now
for me it's good noise and not intrusive enough to divert my attention away
i like that personally
sunlight is my preference
oh yeah
itlll be even worse if i ever get an interior office and gotta lamp light it up
i'll be schleep after lunch
too cozy
my main thing is i have a hard time with direct overhead light
dude
i listened to like half of it
it's GARBAGE
and ofc
rym
worships it

max cringe
i also listened to the new opn twice and haven't been that impressed
i've hated rym lately
i think it's this time of year
lots of big releases
lots of stupid hype
brutal
i was feeling a 1.5 or 2
from what i heard
did you listen to the new denzel
idr
it's super good
just like sonic burger i just obliterated
you'll know it's the best when he doesn't get a grammy for it
8 years in the game and i never rode a wavei may be overlooked but i'm never underpaid
fire emoji
yeah lol
it's gonna suck

this entire page is a complete mess
this is the worst i've ever seen rym
people ailing this shit as revolutionary, people acting like its good, people defending his approach on it
i hate kanye hype
apparently he made it in like a few weeks
it's awful
people are mad p4k gave it a 7.1
oh i'm sure he will
i think he'll trash it
the new cudi comes out this friday
it's gonna suck
i hate this shit
kanye has kind of surpassed needing to be good
his stuff just gets people talking
and it feeds his ego
his second album is going to be just as bad if not worse
yeah
you done played urself
pirate's life is the life for me
i remember when yeezus leaked
i dont think tlop did
i wish we were getting albums like yeezus from kanye still
shit i'd buy
my opinion of yeezus has changed quite a few times
biggest factor being its production
it's like
some weird mixtape album
i wouldn't call it either one entirely
yeah
wolves is good
ultralight beam is some of kanye's best work in a decade
i need to listen to it
he's kind of a gospel artist
lots of influence
if i hear yughk one more time i am going to kms
ye's verse on daytona is pretty good
imo
flow is nice
oh yeah that was weird
idk why that was there
nope
listening now
i saw that
it was a meme
the comments
LOL

this beat sucks ass btw
LOL
LMFAO
IM LAUGHING
HAHAHAHAHAAHAHA
yeah dude what the fuck
yeah this is a troll
i mean he goes on about bars and shit
honestly he fucking killed it it's brilliant
brother android has new music
me too

idk if you'll like this
i think he wrote the whole thing in lsdj
so it's real chiptune stuff
oh wow
not lsdj
an NES
i didn't either
though i've heard that term
i just didn't realize it was referring to the nes
weird
maybe so


is denzel making fun of gucci on his second verse in percs
i'm gonna listen to that today
he is
he has that album
my name is my name or something
with the barcode artwork
i tried to like it in high school
and i couldn't
wtf this realy has a 3.8
yeezus somehow is bolded
weird
it only has a 3.5
shit gonna give me a seizure
this is fucking good though
holy shit this is so good
he basically denounced the entire rap industry
Get it straight I innovate, you adlibs on a 808
haha this is great
oh god i missed it at first but he fired at lil peep
wow
MAN JUST KILLED LIL PEEP AGAIN
i'm listening tot he new pusha t
3.71
he sounds like he's trying to be kendrick
thast's my first impression
this is all produced by kanye right
ill be honest
this is really tame
i'm reserving judgement for the rest
but this first track was like
.. that's kanye
meh yeash
that's what i was thinking
he's like
technically good
i really think he sounds like a boring uninspired kendrick lamar
verses are good, delivery sucks and it ruins everything
his lyricism is honestly pretty above average
this production is fucking boring though
god
rick ross
great
i kinda expected as much
i'm not there yet though
kanye has just kinda
idk man
this is not 3.71 material
it really shoulda been an ep
i think it would be better by way of association
oh this is an album
this is a solid ep
always some extra new hype
listening to this now i can't believe it hasn't fallen more
idk what's going on
honestly i think this release is benefitting from kanye west touching it
this is not very good kanye work
but it's kanye
i mean
TLOP has a decent rating
i think the kanye track has been the best so far
i thought his verse was okay
well that's the thing about tlop
the body is one of my tops
aint it
downloading the new beach house
why would i stream when i can listen to it on musicbee
fucking normie
hmmm
idk
this is certainly a shift from previous beach house stuff
synths are a bit crunchier
i mean i can get behind it
lol what if they do another double album thing
some of this sounds goofy
i thought pay no mind was cheesy
honestly
i'm not getting the sleeping vibe
i'm ngl
this ain't bad
flawed, but decent
how i feel about most of their stuff
ready for it to be over
don't know if i can make it
it's just overstaying it's welcome
that last track is fuckin 7 mins long too

fucc
it's over
3/5
friendly reminder that the sonemic beta is still basically useless

this feedback thread is basically them saying yeah but not really, if we change this it's after launch lol
yeah they're close to pushing new stuff to the beta
and they hired a community and social manager
idk if pushing means a full Beta 5
yeah fucking seriously
the thing is
they aren't going to lose their user base
it's just not gonna happen
i get wanting to expand it
but rn
the new site needs development.
i think that's a mistake
at this point, anyway
yeah
i remember that
last.fm is barely worth even visiting anymore
the body already has a collab album with uniform coming out
these dudes are relentless
brannon put the laptop down on the geek squad counter so hard the laptop breaks in half

sonemic isn't happening
there's no way the money is still there
well
it's gonna e everyone's aoty
the album cover is trash
filler albums are for popular bands
zzzzxx
dude i'm gonna listen to it
but
the body's new album released today
listen to it
ben
listen to the body's new shit
i wanna see what you think of it

the body actually do got some bops
they just make u wanna kms
you just don't get it dude
too normal.....
i'm liking those tags
i'm downloading it

here's the split lp all fixed up so you don't gotta do any werk
i'm not rly feeling this one gotta be honest
this is very aggressive
lmao
listening to harsh now
it aint bad so far
the production is so bad though you can barely hear the guitar
lol
are those bands
ah

you should give this a listen
oh you did already
this side of the thou hits split is literally just nirvana covers p
i'm feeling kinda bamboozled
guess i gotta take back that black sabbath comment LOL
i guess the tone makes it sound heavy metal esque
jamming to considered dead
it's dat u
this is such a good album though
nah dude CD is THE best old school ish death album i've listened to. it's got something about that pushes the envelope and sets it apart
my experience is limited but damn it's so good
the dog has some new music out

is
is this
crossover thrash
maybe more thrashcore
can't tell tbh
whatever it is it's thrashy
feeling thrashcore
lots of blasts and fast tempos
don't it
it's gettin a little more hardcore ish
but those vocals are very thrashy
i voted CT and HP primaries
maybe HC should be a secondary
idk
hard to tell with this stuff

this bandcamp has amillion releases wtf
LOL
holy shit
im listening to this water torture release again lol
EVERYONE I KNOW IS FUCKING DEAD TO MEEEEEE
you ever listen to baptists
yeah
they have a solid crust punk album called bushcraft
grimes is dating elon musk looooool
when u date the greediest capitalist on earth
aw fuck, thou got a new drummer
late 2000s to me
kinda cheesy
yeah
well
idk
okay yeah
thing is
this album came out about 2 weeks ago lol
oh shit
hirs does
you got a link
oh i found it
so
their bandcamp is
hirs
but they go by hirs
but all their shit is the hirs collective LOL
lmao

this song is pretty good and positive
i got invited to something like that i think
idk if it was that exactly
lol this water torture split is fucking wild
i think this is boths sides
idk
nevermind
it's so not
there's a bonus shit release
i love getting a split off bandcamp and fixing it to make it not look stupid as hell

i have to go through and remove each artist from the fucking title
lol
and then change the album artist to HIRS/Water Torture and then the artist name the correct artist

total time 627 LOL
what did you think of that thou joint
for sure
this water torture side is basically recording with a computer mic from the 90s
and everything is liek 10 seconds ling
none of it is going to scrobble

i like this album by agents of abhorrence
toolshed00 being a dumbass on the new thou's genres again
i found that thou/hirs split
up on slsk
search
thou hirs
i might just buy it
idk
i want 320
if its good ill buy it
oh shit
thou's vocalist has some of the best vocals dude
thi is like
old school black sabbath type stuff
with those vocals
lol it has an inbloom cover
lmfao
weird release
i'm starting thikn this is only half
just thou's half


i found the other half
the guy had them in seperate folders and only one of them shows up
did ye get it
also how was that ramlord release
lmao
a good name gone to waste
what a shame
really
i remember it getting pretty bad ratings when it first came out
nvm
that was his back to school pack album
wow acid rap has really been out for 5 years
i remember listening to that one the summer it came out
while i mowed the lawn
gettin nostalgic here
yeah i feel like he's one of those artists with a lotttttt of potential
but his radio presence gets in the way a lil
i tink that's why acid rap was so genuinely good
lol
thou puts out a new EP and its 37 mins long
classic
this is a actually a pretty big deal
they hadn't released anything solo since 2014

this is fucking hiilarious
their bandcamp banner lol

idk how i feel about this release
it's a little bland
chinese time bois
it's a change for them
songs are all standard length
not 8 min doom pieces
they played a new song when i saw them live
but i was drunk and i don't recognize anything in this
i remember it being more upbeat
second half is better
i'm gonna listen again i think i zoned out a bit on the first half
did you say you listened to that hirs/thou release
i can't find it anywhere
it's out, just all there is a preview online
reeee
i listened to the new thou release twice
better second timw throuh
i've not listened to anyting by them
nice
let me know what you think
right off the bat their vocalist sounds a little too metalcore for me
like
late 2000s metalcore
me too
yeah
there's some dark amnbient/noise moments throughout the new thou
it basically is
i think just about every song has a smooth transition
yeah kinda
it's..
very different from older thou
i kinda really liked it ont he second listen
occulting light is fuckin sickk
i prefer the second half
idk about this
it just sounds kinda
the fact's he's doing it by hand is pretty cool
just got there
crazy
lmao
yeah
he's right next to a stovetop or something
i want a wooden knife
this is a crazy amount of manual labor
this has to be hours and hours and hours of sanding

LOLOLOLOL
timestamped
damn dude
nice
you're gonna make it
yeah hahaha i noticed that too
i realized it when i saw vermin womb's album cover on there


did you ever listen to this
it's a kind of neat release
kinda like a postrock album that feel smore like an ambient release. it's just got a lot of cool soundscapes
calling it post rock wouldn't be correct tbh

here's the rym
brannon has indeed heard it
it's good for that
plus the song apathy rule has a fucking cool title lol
checkin soon
listening to boddicker
this is pretty tough
did you ever listen to that false light / discomfort split i think if you like boddicker you'll like that too
it's more grindy than crust


i'll check it out
looks cool
pv is pretty damn cool
yeah definitely
i enjoy the abruptness of it yeah
idk why, exactly
i listened to this one release
oh i think i linked it
shellfire by water torture
that's got some good 'uns in it
it's about 10 mins
too bad they disbanded, i liked their sound
ye
i can't believe you got it all lol
damn kano
lmao
agents of abhorrence have some good stuff
oh yeah
they have a release titled Earth Water Sun or something that i really liked
they're tone is kinda crazy

do you remember ravioli
i mean i like vermin womb
they're kinda deathgrind
ill check those out after this
i just played the most recent upload they have
i like this reeking cross split
think i'm still on reeking cross side rn
oh weird
yeah reeking cross is good
oh yeah vermin womb is on this channel
on throat breach now
i like throat breach more
oh thank fuck
my IEMs are here
oof
yeah good idea
god these things are so muchj better dude
kanye is crazy dude
his tweets have been somethin' else
same
damn
he really changed these days
that is such a different kanye
yeah i saw that
and i'm fine with him having his opinion
like with killer mike being pro gun
as chance said
the 180 between yeezus and like 2016 was pretty jarring though


yeah lol
they ain't nothin too special just solid grindy hardcore
i'm bout to scrobble it
ill see if scrobble full album works now
all the rips of it on slsk are 128k reeeee
huh
rym has this as PV
oh only one person has voted
you think is is PV
fulla lbum is workin again

guess it's on their end
shoot
yeah /
you can't scrobble through the plex app, can you
i'm tryna find it
ah okay
well that's a bit pointless as i use musicbee
i don't think you can from the app
bummer
thanks for the link, i'll set it up
iirc i have my library on google drive so i can use musicbee on my laptop and shit too
for the phone app
day 3 with no IEMs
life has lost meaning
new set is the mail
don't know if i'll make it
Skeletonized by Demon
this really is such a good ep
that one is good too
i noticed that LOL
did i hear something about an album finally coming this year
or was that a joke
oh man
we'll fuckin see lmao
hopefully the production is similar to this ep's
it's so good
sooooo good
oh nice, i'll have to check that out
oh shit lol
i really gotta beef up my youtube subs
i've never used youtube for music correctly
this is my only sub
i'm already liking what i hear
things that are stuff lol
damn dude
at first i figured this was the stuff that came out like last month o
but this is even more unreleased stuff
lmfao
i ain't listen yet but i'm going to soon
i swear LUM just goes like
aight i need some pocket money ima release these tracks that are actually really fucking good

i been lurkin'
waitin' for it to happen
and it went and did it
3 weeks early

it's the one with that single that has ignota on it
it was sposed to come out middle of may
are you at yer computer rn
o
how has everyone's shit turned olut so far
amazing
i remember the game of life group
that had the have you heard of guy right
lord byron
owned
damn this album bout 50 mins long
tags are showing they went a death industrial route
i'm 400th in queue for this obscure ambient release i'm trying to download
ignota is on a lot of these tracks
you know they always have female vocals on their albums
i guess they stuck with her
she has that kind of sound they generally go for
bro
he's not using chicken vocals
WHAT THE FUCK
IS THIS A FEATURE
okay there's chicken vocals
this album is fucking wild
lingua ignota fucking destroys this album
it's convinced me to listen to her stuff
i listened to it tonight
it's good shit


this is a contender for album of the year



i can't remember if you listened to this album but it's one of my favorites from last year

this is more of an ambient techno ish album but it's like listening to techno from a room over, i like it

I'd start with Make Me Know You Sweet here, tbh
can i get a invite to the music server
i'm not gonna be a shitlord
the crypt, as it is called
i'm really glad narga isn't in here
did i tell you i bought another pair of SE215s
i couldn't resist
YIKES
you know
i had an off feeling about that swastikunt guy
ill be honest with you i'm probably gooing to slowly to money boost my alt on cactuar i cannot sit through the story again
dats dat lalafell
some of them do
It's probably the Roegdalyn names you're thinking of
i hate roeg names
i don't think they're randomly generated
welll
they were once
but they're the same for everyone
Roeg names look dumb as shit
each race has a different name generator
Frydwyb is a roeg name
idk about the others
i think that's an option
i could be wrong
Lalafell names are like
the same sound repeated multiple time
like
Chichigo Chigo
Teledji Adeledji
by the way john
LNC/DRGs have a reputation for being idiots
like it's a game wide meme
one time i had a dragoon that straight up just jumped off the platform and tried to tell us he got knocked off
what's brannon gonna play
monk such a fun class
brass knuckles are classic
just pick your favorite
it really doesn't matter afaik
like the wordplay with the name
where do you start as gladiator
whats your screen lookin like
foresty
oh
did you pick cactuar
oh
oh i think gladiator starts in ul dah
oh you mean marauder
turns into warrior
oh you good
youpicked gladiator
thats paladin
i just bought the ARR advancement for my alt
wat
lmfao
i listened to that
good stuff

i'm buying this discog
let me know if you want it


i'm on it
so are some of my friends
my alt is on cactuar
it's one of the biggest NA servers
my main is on balmung which is the most active
nah
i mean
this is a jmmorpg
you have to have the right expectations
play a lalafell no balls
i wish yall could play on balmung
the prblem with balmung
is that's its a very RP heavy server
lots of horny shit
but that's why it's so active
sometimes its like that
other times it's just people hanging out at this one place in ul dah and talking about random lore shit

The Quicksand  Balmung
you'll be fine
there isn't much roleplay at all on cactuar
if you decide to play there
john i'm holding a grudge till you transfer or make a new char on cactuar
i just realized
i can't even play with you john
you're on a different data center
you fool
now i can't carry you through annoying dungeons
remake on the right data center john
you fuck
the people to watch out for are the ones with weeb names
lmao
when are you transferring or remaking john
2 hours what
oh jeez
it's a big boy download
i think it downloads all the expansions
yeah
lol
it's a really expansive game
it's very pretty
especially considering it's based on the ps3 engine or something
maybe its ps4 i cant remember anymore
nice
got any idea what you want to play
class wise
i think you'd like tanking
paldin or something
what did you make on behemoth
but yeah, servers are on certain data centers and you can only play cross world with people from the same data center as you
ill get on my alt soon and add you
Happyhacking Keyboard loooool
cactuar is where i started out and played through like half of the game
i transferred to balmung when i was about halfway through the first expansion
thankfully cactuar is on the same data center as balmung
horrible artwork
idk why that was approved
take picture
make black and white
ugly rgb title
kms
they've really gone down in quality
i used them to shill them so hard
john i resubbed to ffxiv where do you play
me cactuar. you should make a character there i have an alt and a bunch of friends there who will probably play with you
john ok
john
john i made a char on behemoth i found a random ass community from there
me

john once again ignoring his friends
why play with your friends when you can play with probably weeb gamergate RPers
us come do thing that take 1 hour or less
john i'm WORKING
double whipped by donny and work
what race did you pick
final fantasy
i play what is basically the gnome/dwarf class
race

best boye
so why not lala
yes
au 'ra

oh wait

dude to my right
they are honestly kinda cool
i can't really tell them apart in game lol
just lala, roegdalyn, miqote and au ra
yeah
for white mage its pretty good
you gonna buy stroy prog
or go through the whole thing
yeah
you can skip to stormblood
no
i thik the level boost is separate
iirc its 25 to skip ARR, 25 to skip Heavensward, and then you have to play stormblood
and 25 for a level boost to 60
do it
it's free
and play on fucking cactuar
not behemoth
john can transfer
didn't wanna be with his friends foh
35
for all classes
iirc
well i mean back in the day
ah okay yeah
did you ever listen to portrayal of guilt
ye
their split with street sects isn't too good
but i really like their demo
these bands i like need to put out something more than 6 mins long
rym needs an emoviolence tag
i think it's time
REEEEEEEEE

what would you classify this as
i think it kinda breaks the line into EV given the abrupt changes
inb4 PoG goes full emoviolence

uh
they're playing some weird beatdown hardcore stuff here
idk this is not the kind of live show i expected from them
i hope deathwish aint breakin em
there were like
moments where it sounded like a typical beatdown hardcore band
it was weird
yeah there's some old school sounding shit
but there's this one moment im thoinking of in particular
where they just
cut it out
and turn into this beatdowny band
lmao
overall they are pretty old school
their drummer is honestly kinda fucking insane
did you hear that part where they just
that's like a real old school band yeah
yeahhhhh
it's been a minute
i hear it instantly
i like it a lot
some newer skramz stuff is kinda annoying
shit ton of it
caroline is in this facebook group called skram cave
they just taslk about skramz
it's a pretty good group
i like this one band named ostraca

actually one of my favorite releases of last year
i just realized they're from right outside my hometown
they're kinda labeled an EV band
i recommend a full listen 100, it's a great album imo
if you liked that you'll prob like the rest even more as it's the opener for the album
and yeah there's some bands doing really good stuff lately
frail hands, the other screamo hand the guy behind portrait decay is in, is pretty wild
deafheaven has a new album coming out
the single has shit production and it sounds just like their earlier work
father john misty kind of a mysoginst

really aggro power violence
good shit
extremem amounts of edge
that powerviolence release is pretty cool
and 11 minutes long lol
it's got noise in it
FKIN PISED
last.fm only scorbbles like half the release
i love the production
while you're on this
check out III by portrasit decay if you want
6 min release
blackened skramz
that's fair
god they fucking SUCK
retch
LOOOOOOOL
rip in peace
i couldnt' do it
me listening to this black skramz

one of those releases i wish was longer
i think it's fucking sick
right lol
i figured it meant 3 tracks
hadn't gotten put up yet
this guy is from frail hands
a good skramz band with female voc
portrait decay is
ain't this shit fucking sick
there's been some good ass one manners lately
i havent really heard skramz and bm mixed that way
someone called the body screamo at a normie party so i'm done with that word
that's why skramz came to be right
yeah it's a little frustrating
but
i think it might be symbolic of the break in expression people with dementia have
or something like that
yup
lmao
tfw
you successfully fund a new stie and now the old one doesn't even work
2 years later
with no site
dude it's starting to feel like it
the site should have launched by now
honestly the fact the current site keeps going down makes me worried
it seems to happen almost weekly these days
they haven't even tweeted that the site is down
lol
its been down for uh
6 hours or more now
i was having problems with it by 3pm
first it started loading real slow
then it stopped responding
holy fucking shit
please rym
i just found this weird blackened skramz band and i wanna see their rym profile

this sound familiar
gonna be real with u this is good
the production is sick lol
this is a really cool label
lots of weird stuff

extremely gay industrial screaming
this screamo/black metal band doesn't even have an entry in rym
i found a noise album i actually like
Shorn/Flail by HHL
i'm at work and can't really link

it feels good in my ear holes
this is definitely harsh noise wall
but it's not so annoyin
this feels good to listen to moreso. than it actually sounds good
it's just noise
but it's done in a way that it not over the top
if that makes any sense
yeah i feel you
this is kinda like that
but not as long
yeah i had a little jefrecantu kick
love is a stream is his best work though
he basically made a noisegaze album lol
i love this topiary release
yeah i bet so
i found all this stuff througfh bandcamp
is rym being slow for you rn
dunno what's up with it

this is apparently a good release off opal
i sampled a bit of it
let me know what you think of the post awareness stage
that shit fucked with me after a bit
yeah they're very akin to an empty bliss
stage 3 is actually a remix of an empty bliss
idk if you caught that
i recall someone saying the leland kirby figured out how to delete specific frequencies from his music for stage 4
idk if he ended up doing that
but there's like two or 3 more releases to this
hard to imagine witht he way stage 4 sounds

you ever heard of this label
lots of weird noisy drones
i clicked throuhg the tracks
it's very
light light dungeon synth
more of an ambient album imo
ill check them out
gonna inbox them
did you listen the obsdion truth on youtube or something
can't find it on slsk
oh why did it call it that lmfao
found it
you have it
oh
well you have the zip
i dont think you ever unzipped it
i want to buy all of that one label i just linked
their stuff is cheap but no one on slsk really has good quality copies
most of it is really fuzzy drone stuff which is what i'm after lately

im listneing to this
its the guy behind esaggila
yeah, it's a toss up between stage 3 and 4
for me
i gave them both 4 stars
cuz im a sucker for that fuzzy repurposed stuff
with this kinda stuff it's so subjective man
all music rating is but especially when it comes to drone and ambient, noise etc
yeah that's fair
if i'm being honest
it woul dbe hard for me to sit through the whole thing now
the concept behind it is so driving and essential to the music itself it would be a little disrespectful to it not t consider it in your rating i believe
it's a very ambitious project
i've not done a very thorough listen of most of his stuff
it might be pretty interesting to do so
i know he released something right after stage 3
idk how good it is
yeah, i enjoyed that
if i have to guess the next stage will be like that too
this one was a double album
so it was twice as long as the other ones
i hope the rest are about the same
temporary bliss state was really sad to me
right it's a pretty cool project
rym basically dead
shit won't load at all

just got em all sittchiated
this is DOPE
yeah this is a fun release
tfw the only person with a release has 90kbs download speed and they left their computer and your 20th in line
gonna be a bit before i get this on my computer aint it
oh hell yeah
yeah i gotcha saved
where do ye have it located
OHH
i didnt realize you could search user
oh fuck yeah
thanks for that dude
is that for people with member privs only
or can i do that too
so is 0 highest prioroty or should i make it 10
you can also upload stuff straight to me
which i dont mind at all
it all goes straight to me inbox
i gotta share my real library
right now its just stuff i download from slsk LOL
there
its mylinrary now
iz 1 now
i got all the caretaker series if you still need em
just organized it today
that's all of them
a lot of people had taken out the side identifiers and changed the titles
can you make track numbers nonnumerical
im gonna go back at fix that too then
right now it's just in the tite
i still only have about 6 gigs of music
just the stuff i listen to all the time
and lately stuff i've found on bc
you're pushing 200k files i see
you hit a TB yet
been wanting to grow my weird ambient collection the past couple days
some of those labels have interesting releases
that aren't really techno
but rather drone and ambient type stuff withs ome noise thrown in

stuff like this, actually
damn dude
is that all on an external
oh you actually got a release i was about to download
topiary
this is fuzzy
lmao
time to buy more hard drives
you have an anti virus
that's weird
maybe try out avg
and see if anything is up

i was gonna recommend this to you but i think i have already
you rated it
aroundt he same time i found it
almost sure i recommended it
you got it in your library too
i've listened to some other stuff of his
but nothing sticks out quite like this one does
this series gets a releases every march and september
this one ended up coming out in april
ill try to dig up the explanation for the series
THE CARETAKER IS RELEASING SIX NEW WORKS. 'Everywhere at the end of time' is a new and finite series exploring dementia, its advance and its totality. Featuring the sounds from the journey The Caretaker as artist will make after being artistically diagnosed as having early onset dementia. Each stage will reveal new points of progression, loss and disintegration. Progressively falling further and further towards the abyss of complete memory loss and nothingness.
Viewing dementia as a series of stages can be a useful way to understand the illness, but it is important to realise that this only provides a rough guide to the progress of the condition. Drawing on a recorded history of 20 years of recollected memories this is one final journey and study into recreating the progression of dementia through sound.  Stage 1  September 2016 AB Here we experience the first signs of memory loss. This stage is most like a beautiful daydream. The glory of old age and recollection. The last of the great days. Stage 2  April 2017 CD The second stage is the self realisation and awareness that something is wrong with a refusal to accept that. More effort is made to remember so memories can be more long form with a little more deterioration in quality. The overall personal mood is generally lower than the first stage and at a point before confusion starts setting in. Stage 3  September 2017 EF Here we are presented with some of the last coherent memories before confusion fully rolls in and the grey mists form and fade away. Finest moments have been remembered, the musical flow in places is more confused and tangled. As we progress some singular memories become more disturbed, isolated, broken and distant. These are the last embers of awareness before we enter the post awareness stages.Stage 4  April 2018 GHIJ PostAwareness Stage 4 is where serenity and the ability to recall singular memories gives way to confusions and horror. It's the beginning of an eventual process where all memories begin to become more fluid through entanglements, repetition and rupture. Stage 5  Released in September 2018 Post awareness stage 5 may be without description. Stage 6  Released in March 2019 Post awareness stage 6 may be without description.
it is
the one that really got me was stage 3, that's where it gets Good in my onion
holy moly this release just took a turn
damn nice grab

gonna listen to this tonight
supposed to be a strong release by forest management
the only one of his that has impressed me is encounter, which is one of my favorite ambient releases. top 10 all time i'd say. the rest of his works are rather annoying from what i've listened to
that's a good idea
i've been going into work and just using bandcamp discover and stuff. nothing to wild
just find a label and start poking around
yeah
that makes sense
there's so fucking much of it
i found some interesting techno label out of toronto the other day
had some decent stuff
those genres got all the sought after demos and test presses and shit
there's so much fucking noise on there


these are the labels i've just been
going through

i liked this release
MAT has some stale sounding shit though
damn i need to go through opal tapes more
i actually have a release off opal in my library, i forgot
by heinbach
they have some cool stuff
let me dig up the one i liked enought o keep

obscure techno has some of the coolest artwork lol
techno
i haven't found much of that
you have a particular rec
i'm gonna do that at work or this weekend
i'm on this new forest management release
it's loopy
sleepy
i've been working on my music library
almost feel good enough about it to put it on my phone
i really like finding those weird ambient releases that come out of nowhere
its some good shit
been meaning to go back to it
just started it up
oh yeah
it's a lot of repurpised british dance band type stuff
did you make it to the most recent stage
i finished it last night
it was wild

listening to this
v spooky
that is some serious gay screaming

this is kinda dope
hmmm
i'm eating it now
not too much marina
and the crust is dope
but i think in overall flavor dominos wins
the 3 topping large one
ah
well i'm on a za kick
so i'll prob do that shit
dude same
garlic sauce so fucking GOOD
i've been getting a lot of it
i've been doing
pepperoni, bacon, and onion
wit the garlic sauce

this is quite the.... interesting line up
birds in row bout to hit it big
neurosis and converge crowds are p big
they're gonna get a lot of exposure off of this
yeah i've heard the same
yeah i don't think i've listened to them
neurosis i mean
i've listened to some old converge and their newest album
they definitely aren't as wild as they used to be
the new album is pretty decent
but just lacking in comparison

wew


you might like this
you probably gon' roast my ass for this but do you listen to any idm

this is a good release

this one is also good
woulg has a lot of good stuff, i've been listening to woulg for a solid 6 years or so now. just got back into him recently
those releases got a lot of noisey and glitchy sounds to them
the seskamol one esp
ohhh opal tapes
they put out some sick stuff
nah i agree with you

i'm listening to this
dunno if this is the kinda stuff you've been on lately
lots of really crunchy saw wave stuff in this one
the caretaker released a new part to everywhere at the end of time
it's postawareness now
the tone has completely changed
if you haven't listened to any of this yet i recommend you start now
yeah
idk if you mean the whole thing or just this release
but its good stuff
if you liked an empty bliss youll like the first 3 parts of everywhere at the edn of time for sure
just start from the top
it starts gettin a little twisted at stage 3
before that, it's about what you'd expect from an empty bliss type stuff
im a quarter into stage 4 and it's kinda wild
very sound collagey
damn brannon got the audio guide going
i jus cane here to say i can't enough of this primitive man release
it scratches that itch i have got Fucking Heavy but also really grating
already on it
i skipped the battle jacket and went straight to a tattoo jacket
i don't wear a shirt anymore
attempted suicide in general so what's everyone's opinion on pizza hut
i'm bout to try it for the first time in like, a decade
gonna eat that fuckin stuffed crust boi
they were a a bigger title
although they hadn't released anything in years iirc
i've been listening to oathbreaker a good bit lately
that girl can skrem
ain't too much coming out i've heard about
i've been out of it lately
ryuichi and alva cane out with something
it was a bit of a let down
decent drone
that's all
rip
vidya
it'll do it
oh yeah i've heard that ones good
they recently ported some of the bosses on that one to raids in ffxiv
endgame stuff so i'm not there yet
if you ever wanna try ffxiv lmk and i can refer you
you get a free trial too
i think you can level every class to 35 or something, but some features are prohibited iirc
oh that ones turn based isn't
it
ffxiv isn't
oh yeah
its an mmo
mmorpg i guess
idk how big roleplaying is in wow, but certain servers have a lot of RP activity in ffxiv
but its basically the same deal
you got yer character
with a class
and you fight baddies in a party
ffxiv's leveling is just based around a storyline progression
the server i started out on had like no RP but the one i moved to play with my gf has a large rp community
i guess ffxiv has unofficial ones
Faerie and Balmung
im on balmung
i recently got into crafting and its ruining my life
there is.... so much to do
im halfway through the second expansion in the storyline
i burned myself out
oh discord picks up spotify mobile
thats cool
im streaming on my phone
ye

this shit
idk whats playing btw it just kept playing shit after birds in row lmao
i've been using it less
trying to transfer over to an offline library and then a NAS of some sort eventually
but i still need it on my phone
yeah i was gonna just use plex starting out
it's a monthly sub right
trying to stay away from those atm
i wonder how much more data something like plex mobile would use over spotify
using spotify in my car has never caused data problems but im pretty sure .ogg files are smaller than your standard 320kpbs mp3
regardless, i got about a month to cut spotify premium out
so i need to get on it
i changed my rym collection to help me track what i've downloaded, what i like and haven't downloaded yet, etc
why u kicc the boy
bot
where my muhfuckin dominos at, shit
we should have a dominoes and anime night at tech one day
that's a dead man wit his eyes open
he seen HIMSELF die
young and in the way fuckin DEAD
deathwish dropped them over sexual assault allegations and they're done playing shoes
shows
they also put out the world's dumbest statement

they were like we support the victim also we didn't do it not discrediting her but we didn't do it we support her tho
it was their response that was stupid as hell
they're talking about how the victim was in the right but also that they didn't do it and won't accept fault
even tho the victims recount completely contradicts what they said
how you gonna support the victim when you're also saying her recount is wrong
yeah
it was dumb as hail
im glad it wasn't one of my favorite bands
bro if birds in row got outed for something like that i'd cry
literally
well the fact they broke up is kinda like uhhhhh
most bands don't if they deny the allegations
these days yeah
that's a good point
i was just about to say something about how Taake didn't give a shit
what taake thing
well taake is a bm band right
yaitw is bm/crust hybrid, i can see it
i do agree it is a little odd tho, given deathwish and all
yeah
i guess that tour doesn't particularly help their case, from an identity standpoint
i hope no more deathwish bands get caught for something like this
well
let me clarify
i do
but i'll be disappointed especially if it's from deathwish
pinegrove
lol
still no closure on that shit
they been busy as fucc
the new single is good shit
finally dug into this entombed release
yeah, the buzzsaw is really coming in now
unmistakable
the most recent primitive man release is fuckin HEAVY
i haven't listened to the whole thing yet. the spotify radio for the new The Body song keeps playing tracks from it, so i just started it
i'm at lunch tho so in gonna put it on when i'm done
it sounds real good tho
lmao
spotify really wants me to listen to it
so i'm gonna
usually it plays stuff i've heard already
the vocalist seems to have opted for a deeper pitch
dunno if i like it
the kick is honestly a little over the top
looks like the album comes out january of 2018
hmmm
downloading the ep
dunno about the guy's vocals but i like their sound
ah yeah this is pretty much crust/dbeat with death metal vocals, ha
i like it


hype
didn't expect this
just remembered the new mammoth grinder released yesterday
today actually
god damned kick sounds like floor tom lol
for fucks sake
i'm giving code orange an honest listen and i can't believe this is above a 3 on rym
there's fun moments
but honestly it's like listening to a slightly better emmure most of the time

it's kinda like if emmure's secondary genre was hardcore/beatdown instead of deathcore and they did post hardcore sometimes
and no rap lmao
yeah i could see that
ya it's kinda choppy
lmao
i've never watched them live
dudes in hardcore are wild
the vocalist for trap them broke both of his legs jumping off a monitor and still toured in wheelchair
dude hurts himself like every show
never stops
i wanna see them live real bad
yeah i can appreciate them doing their own thing
but idk beatdown is so stained by the ego shit it provokes
it's hard for me to see it in a great light lol
i've been hitting up the stuff i usually listen to like crust and shit during the day but i've gotten back into 'splorin ambient stuff
i highly highly recommend that pendant album if you get in the mood for that kinda thing
was thinking about trying that and just keeping a version on a thumbdrive
idk
might not work the way im imaginging it
how do you have it set up
impressive tbh
new The Body boiiiiii

their own releases come pretty consistently every two years but they always do a bunch of collab work in between
and yeah they did drop that EP and the collected works things too
this album like hugs your earholes

i think this is my kinda ambient
the quiet stuff
caroline is telling me to listen to altar of plagues
ill check them out then
when you be browsing a tag on bandcamp and finally find something real cozy to listen to
took long enough
the drone tag sorted by recent is really a mess
yeah it really is
i used to do it more often
feels great when you find that release you enjoy though

i like the production on this
its very muddy

what's the point of this
lol
im gonna be honest here altar of plagues aint bad at all
lol
i mean im not really surprised
y'all ever put a Memphis Mayfire sticker on yer truck
you started that ryuichi pick yet
production dry af
what you think of the pick
the music wasnt bad, but i didnt like the execution
i swear every new song kai straw puts out is worse than the last
have you heard cherry corvette
i mean same, i just happened to see him tweet about it
you ever listen to brian mcbride
one of the dudes from sotl
he has this album When The Detail Lost Its Freedom and i almost prefer it to SotL stuff
im listening to the new converge singles and you're right, calvaiire reallyis heavily influenced by these guys

have you heard All I Wanna Do by the beach boys
you gonna nut

i had no idea they had a song like this
its basically a dream pop song
do you remember if seasick records has shit from The flenser and deathwish records
have you ever added a concert to rym before
im trying to add the small ball and the boris show
but it looks like the find page is busted
reeeeee
hell yeah
theuy're due for a new one


it's a little weak imo
the drummer's kick sounds like a fucking low tuned floor tom though lol
lol
LMAO
lol
a lot of my scrobbles are from shit i dont really listen to much anymore
by the time i had converted to glitch and stuff, my usage of last.fm started to fall
ill move all my glitch shits
damn lots of brian eno
i never listened to him that much
its always a good time to start
might gotta gib boutta a min
mine did that too
there was a point in time when my last.fm looked real neat
now it just looks like shiposting but in music
do you have a rym ben
yeah i havent been rating stuff much lately
ive tried to not think about it too hard
yeah
i might clean out my rym again as well
unrelated but im a fucking sucker for this Caretaker stuff

i change mine too
especially like months down the road
why the fuq i give this a 4 back then
i would do the mookid thing but im too lazy
i aint never like a review ive written anyway
rip
gotta override
i think nicole has an iq of like 30
i rated the last weekly
sorry i thought you got kicked

would have rerolled anyway lul XD
why does everyone in there think my music taste is shit just cuz i picked cult leader in mmd
its literally memes
that entire channel is shitposting 99 of the time
also the last weekly was a trollpick
fair enough
it felt like a troll pick though
my least favorite out of everything so far
excluding interpol
brnnon
fuck
im listening to music for church cleaners
got like one more song left
its pretty nice
nice atmosphere
although i think i would have to be in a certain mood to listen to this again
ill find volume 2
yeah
i really like this last track
that was pretty good for improv
ghosted as hell

lul
oh look at me, my music is SPESHUL
icing on the cake is
goldroom makes nudisco
aka daft punk core
ya it's what you'd expect
I've never understood why people are so anti genre
how are you supposed to have meaningful discussion beyond it's good/bad without categorizing
Also this goldroom album sucks
Oh look at me, I can do 4onthefloor radio beats
It's ok tho, I can just call people who try to contextualize my music lazy
holy shit
every song sounds the same
are you tech btw
You at
distinguishing black metal from ambient music is lazy

what i expected death doom
what i fucking got slam

i fucking hate these vocals
100 a drum machine

its basically a clone of this band
same hgh pass drums
lmao
does anyone actually listen to slam because they think it's good
oh look at me
i can hurt my vocal chords
i can make generic death metal with a a drum machine
who is minutelad
is that aske or danny
rec me something ambient/drone you dont think ive heard before
thanks mane
i remember you reccing that music for church cleaners album awhile back
i need to get on it

i started using my new last.fm
i don't know if im going to stick with it just yet but i figured i'd try a fresh start
ive had mine for over 3 years and brannon's new one has already surpassed mine
my old one is only at like 36k
part of me doesn't want to start using the new one but i hate the name
how so
like with the correct date and shit
well maybe i could do that
or ambient rather
yeah
i dont like that stuff

i recommend this
i think its telepath who has this project called virtual plaza or something
its a lot of stuff like that
new agey almost
virtual dream plaza

hours and hours of music
that i could never really find a groove with
basically
its all sampled
veryeasy to do
the charm kinda starts to fade when you realize how much of vaporwave is just.... ripped off music
but youll like that hke/tele split though
its like proto 2814
yeah
that helps
but it still gets a bit bland
whenever i get picked on crypt weekly, im debating whether i should rec a glitch album or a drone album


i actually need to revisit that album
what do you think of it so far
yeah same
i think the third telepath track is a bonus from a reissue
BLCR labs is a weird label for me
there's a lot of stuff i hate on it
and then a few absolute fucking gems that i frequent
oh
i think you got the older editoin
the newer one has three telepath tracks
ah yeah
i just started the bonus telepath track
ah
this is off of rain temple i think
doesnt fit the album at all
i skipped
was gonna kill the mood
if you like HKE's side of this tape youll like his album HK
yeah
remember has a pretty good album
axico industries is kinda trash though
ah yeah
i have it as a 7 too

i recommend revisiting this one too
lol
s u p e r i o r
the second hke track
is NUTS
its my favorite off the release

definitely hit this album back up then

people have hyped thius album up
i think i tried listening to it once
but didnt get far
i should try it again
you still on the 11 minute hke track
i fucking love this song dude
monolord has a new album coming out
hmmm
idk if the others are any good cuz i dont think ive listened
but that one is fun
all these album covers on orange milk look like they were made by some 17year old jerkin it to vektroid
nice

ill try it
i just started
just realized scroblr aint beenw orking all this time
my last.fm is a disaster
just spamming oathbreaker and cult leader while im in the car
lol
and doesnt work on anything else
does it work on ethernet only
ah
yeah i might have to do that
youre right this album is hard to digest
its so disjointed
look at the title of the last track
i get a bad feeling
you using the IEMs
imo they definitely make a difference when listening to this stuff, at least going from what i was using
im on track 2
idk dude i just dont see how this could be enjoyable to anyone
look
in any other way than an audio experience
cool sounds and shit, but this is not enjoyable in a musical sense to me
okay just got to track 3
i guess i am starting to hear some musical elements
but this is annoying
maybe
maybe it gets more coherent throughout the album
audio poem really making me mad
id like whatever this track actually is
and its 14 min long
great
hmmm id say audio poem was my favorite track so far
this aint too bad
no annoying skipping
im almost done
i liked this better as it went on
but it was kinda tiring
im listening to hazard garden again as well
its been a minute
i love atmosphere on this album
glad you liked it
yeah i think the second half is better too

this is lillith under a different name
more like
beat oriented
glitched out rap samples, shit like that
fun album to thrown on and do shit while its in the background
i just started rendered fantasy
i think i tried to listen to that
eh
didnt care for it
maybe i should give it another try
ive noticed a lot of telepath's solo work is kinda of run of the mill drone
how do you like em
Which buds are you using
Which ones The memory ones
ah yeah, try da medium ones. I had to go back up to medium
and they stay in
Yeah, it took me a few days to get used to them. And yup. The better the plug you get the better they sound
They clock out so much sound though, it's awesome
Yeah. Very clear imo
I'll stick em in for awhile in a place where there's like an AC unit running and other ambient noise and then take them out after awhile and be surprised how muh sound there is
orange milk
woo boy
im on some ambient bullshit rn
might check that out later
oh
iw ont then lol
orange milk aint known for friendly music
oh what the fuck is this
come on
its literally just sounds
essentially.
i cant believe this has a 3.27 on rym
okay maybe i can
but its still annoying
rym cred

im sampling this
seems a little more coherent
yeah
it reminds me of uh
lillith
in a different way
oh
its DDS
i didnt look at the artist
that makes sense
be wary, glitch has changed in style in modern days
that's why i gravitate to all the early 2000s stuff
so if you go in expecting to hear some of that old school style it might not be there
LOL
let me sample it
im not at all surprised an rymcore server hypes shit like this
you got me wanting to browse through some orange milk stuff
iv e tried a couple times
its definitely moving towards this postinternet stuff though
which is largely annoying to me
did you ever listen to those lillith releases

this one
i didnt even know
wtf
am i dead
uhhhh i don't know what to make of what i just listened to
idk
like
i really dont know
go listen to soft hair
lmao
he's playing heroes of the storm now
so there's that
listening to la priest and playing heroes of the storm
why
Corbin has a new single
oh sweet I didn't know you listened to him
He's got a new album out on the 5th it seems
This Corbin track is growing on me
Just like Ice boy did
oh shit
hmmm
i wonder what that means
i hope you hate rap
lol
new Corbin album is out today boys
I listened to a few tracks on the way to class
he's definitely ditched the 2013 sad boy stuff
the new Corbin album is sitting pretty well with me
i think he's still figuring it out, but he done growed up
eh
idk
he's pretentious as hell
he's full meme dude

narga.jpg
They're reviewing the new War on Drugs album on NPR and this is trash
Boring ass 70's shit
That's better
Why's everyone got a boner for that 70's rock shit lately
it's BORING
oh look at me
i can write rhythms done a thousand times over and pair them with a piano

Who told sampha this was a good look
this is pretty dope
defintely a wild listen
also love how old school it sounds in production and general style
honestly ive enjoyed it and think i will continue to enjoy it for its remainder
it's stayed fresh
yeah ive been meaning to check the podcast out
yeah for sure
the production is sick
like
really sick
when i saw the date on spotify, i was like this must be a reissue then
cuz it reminds me of 90s bm
then his headphones suck
i can hear it just fine
oh no
ban
he really fuckin posted lamg of god
wouldnt that be closer to groove metal
i passed out and almost hit my head at the gym while listening to Fake Messiah by Lamb of God
8th grade
dark times
my body just hates me
oh my god im listening to fake messiash
this is SO bad
On dat erosion of sanity shit

god i fuckin love these shure IEMs
they block out all sound at cu
at least in the study room
idk about if i was like, at a table
that et tu hemo picture cracks me up

dope track
They get FAST

i think hke sold dream catalogue
lol
o
alice glass has a new ep
ohyeah that's right
im hype for that
yeah he does
im kinda surprised to see that third side of tape is bolded and OA isn't
about the new blanck mass, in a way it kinda fills the void that the latest crystal castles album left
different style still but its still that brand of edgy synth type of stuff
someone put it pretty well in a review
you could almost consider it a popish industrial influenced record, its pretty accessible as far as this kind of stuff goes
yeah, its interesting
i wonder what comes next

sangam has so many releases i havent been able to keep up lol
yeah dude
lol
maybe ill check one out
i just started purpose
god i love this guy's production
just skimmed it
hmmmm
damn
that's retro sounding shit
very raw
i kinda dig it. little awkward
regardless, i think his voice in this style is better than his older stuff
im listening to bladee LOL
it's like discount yung lean

im listening to this rn
about halfway through
so far i kinda disagree with the avg rating on rym
it's not trying to do anything very special, it's just really nice to listen to
a lot of people are comparing it to OPN in the reviews and shit and i don't think that's fair
apparently slowdive's new album is good
I just checked it on rym
I hated the single
lol
you'd like this
wow y'all are talkative

new Murkok release
Shit is murky. Hope we hear more like this from him
Wish it was longer
I'm nutting this shit is dope
Also the body and full of hell have a new collab coming out
yup
maybe this one will be more cohesive
would rather them work with Thou tbh
The new one has a pretty sick title
ascending a mountain of heavy light
wtf
Tyler the creator has a bolded album on rym
I didn't even know a new one had come out
While ass album
Released July 21
3.73 on rym
You know who I want some new shit from
Earl sweat
Stayin inside
Hopefully making music
I feel like he's gonna kill hisself
At some point
Or try to
im listening to stained galss revelations
which one
The swarvy one
oh it's a just a couple tracks
I thought the one track was pretty fun
lmao
the lead synth on krunchwrap is just sick
melody, w/e
good shit
Islands of memory is so dope

yeet
Was just trying to find it actually
Yeah, MLJ was like lol no
yeah LOL
I've never heard anything else by mlj ever lol
Chipotle plays it
I always think I'm gonna hear kai's verse when it comes on
same. like idc if you no longer want to write about depressing shit, just make your music worth something
and ofc he gets more traction when he starts doing it

his new album is going to be exactly like his album from last year
who knew it was easy to write generic music
Oh yeah I heard this
God it sucks
jamesthebear is a trash producer
The fact he doesn't his music anymore is like
Actually heartbreaking
He's a talented as fuck producer
I'd rather him just produce abstract hip hop for other artists than make this garbo pop music
Same dude
Pearl whitney or TTD, everyday
yeah i found em on bandcamp right after decoupage got released
listening
oh btw the newest blanck mass album is pretty good
yee ed showed me, i gotta listen to it
i hope we get another ep or something
lol
phew
yeh he pushes it dude
narga has said some really dumb shit
i mean
he got kicked once already
but that was by xzf right
oh lol
oh yeah he got banned
oh i didn't even know lmao
oh yeah that shit
oh is he gay
backpedal. lmao
WTF
dude
i can't believe i missed this shit
i won't tell anyone
i love how he actually dated a trans woman and now goes off about trans people being mentally ill
wtf
wew
Looks like arscade fire's new album is shaping up to be a flop

dis is kinda wild
Listening to some electronic music with these new IEMs is so cool
im hearing new things
especially in the Shuttle358 albums
I'm listening to Insen
good shit
Been awhile
Picking up frequencies I couldnt really make out before. This is awesome
these IEMs really shine with electronic music
why nicole gotta rec this repetitive shit
reeeeeeeee
it's decent, but its so repetitive
gonna go 6/10
and yeah he is
kinda seems like he wants to be one lol
didn't killswitch drop his staff role
i have it

the controls are good but technically difficult to learn
yikes
celeste is such a good game
if yall like side scrollers i highly recommend it
i'm like 6/7 of the way through it
it's hard
streaming overwatch, badly

that's a god damn texticle

i'm assuming casting classes in WOW have something similar Swiftcast where you can cast something instantly
and waste it
rip one of my messages didn't send
what i said was
something about my hotbar keeps causing me to fat finger it
and waste it
well this ability to makes the next ability with a cast instant
then swiftcast goes on a 60 second CD
it's really useful to combo with Raise which has a 7 second cast time
tfw a 20 min video takes 4 hours to upload
oh shit you bought it
well look at dat you were pullin 60 fps
well, almost
i just hit level 70 whm on ffxiv
ye
im on the stormblood expansion
im actually about 9 levels ahead because i stopped doing storyline for a bit
i guess ffxiv avoids that by locking each zone by story
even though i stopped doing storyline and kept leveling, all of the solo duties/dungeons/trials etc syn to the recommended level in the storyline
i think im gonna level a monk next
hurrah
have you thought about going to twitch
oh yeah you gotta pay to keep em right

can we start at 315 or so
I gotta run by subway
I haven't eaten
I'm getting it to go

wormarc has no real motivation to do anything. he reacts to the things immediately around him and usually will go wherever there is some sort of action or money, or some other thing that beneifts him
wormarc is pretty much a loose cannon
anything bad that happened to him in his past he's completely buried
aka i havent figured it out yet give me time
Start at lvl 3
would y'all be okay with doing DnD later in the evening on Sunday
Like 6 or 7
Since we don't have school on Monday
Antechamber 2
dope
I wanted to play later so I could get some more shit done before we started
im drownin'

check this shit out
my DM made this weapon for my light cleric gnome
SO sick
i cant wait to get it
gnomes aren't proficient in warhammers so our dragonborn has to teach me to be proficient in them
5
i wouldnt
half orc barbarian boys
I'm shooting for 10ish
LOL WHAT
There's a line where you really need to ask yourself if it's worth it or not
not at all
Will check it out when I get home from retrieving my McDick's
Also it feels fucking amazing outside rn
Ima get some double cheeseboigas
It's like in the 70s
75

my other DnD group is meeting every other week now so if it's possible could we meet on the week my other group doesn't If not that's fine, just if it's possible and it works out for everyone else
do you get sneak attack at level 1
Use dungeon painter studio
John you're insufferable
Idk
I haven't started
john
look at yourself
and consider the choices you're making
And his deity is Pelor
Nah I'm a cleric in my other campaign
He's fucking sick
Warren Crookedthorn. Rock Gnome. 150 years old. AC of 18 lol
I could be a wizard or something
Or sorcerer
I mean if we got two, one damage dealer and one kinda healer with a decent AC would be pretty good
For the debuff thing
yeah
that would be cool
I can only do once a week mane
I have another group I do on Fridays
Did he mean twice a week for each group
He would kill hisself
Or
Bimonthly

I can do bimonthly for sure
Just can't do Fridays
Sundays would be dope
btw roll20 is pretty sick
honestly you oculd use it pretty effectively irl
instead of having physical maps
Dungeon Painter Studio
I think it might be integrated with roll20
My project lead is a good writer. Well conceptually at least. He's told me some of storylines. They're dope
like he described a campaign to me and I thought it was premade
nope, he made it all from a single sentence he read
My cleric's divine domain is Pelor
Well
It's light
deletes server
deletes server
my DM doesn't tell us the hit point of the creatures we fight, it makes it more fun
And we also don't know the hit points of our party memebers
Just how they look
it makes it feel more real
Also consider starting at lvl 3 or something, we started at level 5
Yeah stuff like that
how much damage no
yeah
What was that premade called
Something of Strahd
one of my other friends is gonna do that one
Yeah
They're skipping the house tho
What were you gonna do Brannon
We can duo it
The anti bard thing seems kinda cool
I've never multi classed
so austin and i have an idea
we wanna scrape asrtstation for wallpapers
but i might have to use javascript
i can't straight up web scrape with python because the DOM is based on JS generated code or something
anyone interested on working on this
side project, eh
why the fuck did my scraper scrape this

okay this markov stuff is pretty cool
messing around with song lyrics
i took all of the lyrics from an album and shoved them in a text file.
i think im going to make a separate bot for this markov thing
i messed around with it last night and theres actually not a clear way to get message history from a single user
i figured it out
i got every message i've ever made in here

yeah i'm bout to
i got it1. loading all past messaage, to be run once before going live2. adding all future messages from me
i've sent over 12000 messages in here
well
a lot of it is spam
in the seceret spam channel none of you guys have access to so i don't bother you when i'm running tests
i need to figure out how to remove1. links2. bot commands done3. user IDs from mentions4. random text strings from keyboard mashing
that should sanitize text fairly well
just regex'd those two yeah

i don't really know how to get making at leat somewhat coherent sentences
mylack of punctuaion makes this hard
so i was having an issue
so i was having an issue

are you around

look at what the bot does
i got it to pretend to type for a random time and change up the sentence length
it's a little creepy
needs to be 4 to 6
3 and less is dumb
but i gave up and just went through all the contents of  as a str with regex
i think there'sa way to isolate the json with regex and xpath
but i have yet to find it
i was about to give up on the whole project because i wanted that json object so damn bad
sometimes you just gotta say fuck it and get something working
that's what i learned at parsons

this bout saved my life
i couldn't get the json isolation part to work though
i might go home and mess with it some more
getting the json on its own would change the game
unrelated but i'm gonna make the bot respond  every time someone says john
i hate john
WHAT
NOOO

i hate john

yeah it's offline you dumbass
now it's online
that can be fixed with one call
John sucks
jOhN
oh worm
that's strasnge
i call lower
it shouldn't matter
john
JOHN
oh the bot is dead
oh that's right cuz i loaded my bandcamp scraper
duh
i need to host the bot on amazon aws
so Track will be composed of filepath isreleased title number
maybe Track won't need to inherit
i was gonna have it inherit albumtitle from Album but i don'tt hink that will be necessary
i think you get the idea but album will contain a list of tracks
well
shit
i'm trying to figure out how to pair up urls with track titles
when everything is released, it's fine
but when there are unreleased tracks, there's less urls than there are track titles
so if i wanted to make a function likedef addtrack
how do i pass a Track object in
yeah
okay
wew
i think the hardest part of python is thinking pythonically
i'm way too used to writing c code
yeah, opposite thing for me
holy shit
what was the fix
did you see the new .weekly feature
it takes artists, tracks, or albums as aparam
try it out
like those words
lol
i'm gonna add number of plays as well
mine looks like shit cuz of that beat tape
is that all grind
oh yeah you showed me that i think
when u get into the zone it happens
i've sat there with my headphones in and no music playing for over an hour
i've gotten so into writing web scraping stuff altely
i coded all day yesterday
i haven't been like this in years
i wish i could apply that to school
i worked ont he bandcamp scraper basically all day long
without listening to music
i just tunnel vision
angular looks interesting
i'm really trying to immerse myself in python rn
i cannot believe it took me so long
i'm still surprised yall didn't go with react
i'll check it out
right now i'm looking at stuff like c and python
i believe if i get this job at oasys i'll be working in c
i know angular is a platform
but JS itself is a little foreign to me

python has been really easy to pick up imo
i was suprised
like i'm usin regex and shit
and web scraping
from the get go
i want to think of more web scraping projects
yeah
i was gonna write somethin like that too
what'd you use xpath
oh okay
i'm using xpath in the bc scraper
BS seems a little more intuitive
i tried out bs but stuck with xpath cuz i understand it a bit more for whatever reason
xpath looks a little hairy
script  strtree.xpath'//scriptcontains., var TralbumData /text'
basically you're saying
find the  tag that contains var TralbumData and give me the text output
i think
idk wha the . does
i can't remember
ohhh it's current node
in yer html
idk xpath does a lot of shit
i want to get good at it
cuz i kinda like it or scraping
i didn't get to really utiltize it in the bc sraper
bandcamp deters people from doing what i just made
all the data is inside this really ugly json object inside a
it's formatted poorly and with newlines
ideally i would isolate the json
i use json for databases in my bot
but ive never had to get it from somewhere else
well
javascript is a pain
im using python rn
and i like it a lot
try some python ones out
its pretty ez
especially if yourenot web scraping
it can get hairy when youre on the web
if you want to check out the bot, the repo is pinned on this here channel
i havent pushed in a bit
YOOOOO i did it
i said
fuck json
and used regex in a string of the  tag

here's the script if anyone wants to check it out
it's a bit primitive at the moment
the folder naming convention doesn't work at for stuff with weird unicode text like
but for normal text it works ok
this was fun
it's not going on github for obvious reasons
one day i want to do it the proper way and grab stuff from the actual json object, not just a string

updated
downloads cover art now
i don't really know what to do about stuff with weird unicode characters in it
discord bot


i added tagging to the bandcamp scraper
bandcamp scraper 7/5/2018

well it seems your coworker doesn't want to use it properly
oh jeez
i gotcha
is that because the model is freezing up
that sounds frustrating dude
that's how it be sometimes
days to figure out one thing
yeah
that's gonna take some serious optimization if it ain't just slow
i mean
databases ain't always fast
would you say your api has high overhead
shit is so frustrating to work with
well
just keep in mind it aint your fault the damn thing is slow
that should def help
if only even a little
hell yeah dude
i'm waiting on oasys to call me back
i need MONEY
this is so sad
had to use a try/except
bot's fucked up and i'm at uah lol
it will send it like 3 more times probably
i'm think i'm going to write some more functions using pylast to scrape info about an account's top played for the week and stuff
i gotta get my hands dirty in it
i have no idea what it actually is
i'm sitting here writing the most brain dead instructions for gimp rn

wew
nahhhh this is documented already
i think
but jesus fucking christ using APIs with no doc sucks
i'm talking about pylast
i had to use their test code to figure out what the fuck to do
apparently you can get album artwork from pylast
will update on results
oh yeah baybey
now i have to resize it and shit
how does this look
i might get rid of the emojis
one sec
should be up now
lol
i had it to where it will grab the last track you scrobbled if you aren't currently scrobbling
but
eh
i'm gonna remove that for now
it's ugly repeated code
i'm gonna try to fix it later
yeah doesn't work when not scrobbling
that's ok
i like how it expands the card to fit everything
lol
i like the emojis
gives a lil color
np
i'm thinking about changing it to fm though
which do you like better
bot is up for the day
yall got any ideas for how to do a .roll command
i have the multiplier and the  of sides split into their own variables
but i'm trying to think of how to like
basically do
call randsides times the multplier
i think i'm gonna need a function
nah nvm
i forgot what a for loop is
nevermind me
i just rewrote the .np function

have i taken this too far boys
seems like onmessage messes up my bot
did you problems with this
does nothing
but
ping
works
yall have any features you want me to implement or want to implement together
i need some ideas
i see you want darkest dungeon on steam, it's 7.49 now
i played it for a bit
it's tough
i got a challenge
so i decided i wanted to try to pull all the mp3s from a bandcamp album page for fun right
well the tricky part is that theyre all in json object inside a  tag
i used xpath to get the script isolated but i cant figure out how to extract the json object
i did try context.args

like
in the function i did ctx.args
do yall use git in studio code
oh this is really nice
vs code
how did i just hear about this shit a couple weeks ago
damn
i still don't know how to acces the args param
it's a list right so i'd have to iterate on it like
for i in ctx.args    printargsi
right
i'm not too good with python syntax

so i can acces the full message including the command with ctx.message.context
but i still think i can get just the arguments without the prefix
i made a spam channel so i'm constantly pinging this one
bada bing bada boom baybey
so i think the issue was it was only getting one argument or something
i just took ctx.context.message and sliced off the prefix and command
yeah theres a function that does that for you
in urllib
next up i want to do a .np command
was also thinking of like
adding a DnD suite of commands
i pinned the repo for you guys to branch if you want to work on some stuff
so i got thebasic function to work
it checks if you're currently scrobbling. if you're not, it pulls your last scrobble
i used pylast

we could probably the user database thing as simple as a json file for right now
or a google sheet
try setting your username
with .npset
bot should be running all day
will it work with my local json file

basically just do
lol oops
probably
ayyyyy
right now it's just a json file
really primitive
but
seeing as we're the only two using it, it will work for now
yeah, it works well
easy enought to deal with
idk what to do next
those were the 3 big ones i really wanted to add
like fmbot's
oh yeah that's what i'm doing
with an embed
but
idk how to grab the album cover
i'm not sure what fmbot uses. i'm using pylast
i couldn't find an api call for it
i'll look into that
the .np feature could definitely look better
so the check for a valid username doesn't actually work
i need to fix that
username verification works now
go away uber bot
just crashed IDLE
I DID IT

and  too cuz you'll appreciate this
i'm gonna
my other friend recommended it
i just want to get something going
lol
but no this is cool
it just queries youtube and take the top result
3 lines of code
bot.commandasync def ytctx, q str    query  urllib.parse.quotequery    search  urllib.request.urlopen    result  re.findallr'href/watchv.11', search.read.decode    await ctx.send
ah shit
idk how to do the monospace
bot.commandasync def ytctx, q str    query  urllib.parse.quotequery    search  urllib.request.urlopen    result  re.findallr'href/watchv.11', search.read.decode    await ctx.send
oh okay, cool
that's wrong code, i changed the param back to q instead of query
in query  blah
fuck man
okay something weird is going on
that's not the right video
cuz this
returns the right video
but my command doesn't
yeah that's probably it
yeah, that's it
ohhhh
hmmm
it's cuz the command expects one param
yeah
like
i need an array i guess
idk how to do it without forcing the user to use quotes
i reckon i could use argv
is ctx the full line passed
i think i need to use the ctx args list
but it won't print

i need to acces args
do you guys know how i'd do that i can't figure it out
or javascript
ther's no json
put that in the folder where the repo is
oh
yeah i don't udnerstand git too well

what'd you add to your json
i'm guessing it's just token  tokenval or something

this shits
so when i sub the actual value in for token in boy.py, it will know
bot
ohhh import json
is json installed by default
think i got it
throwing an error

here's the config file i have
json.decoder.JSONDecodeError Expecting value line 1 column 1 char 0
this is my error
but
SO is all about urls
not a config file
when your tutorials use a library you made yourself and the syntax sucks ass

lol
oh wow
3.7 came out today
i'm gonna stay on 3.6 for now
i'm stumped man
well shit
he'll yeah lol
that fixed it
taking the var name and semicolon off
lol
don't know why its name is still quiet bot, i changed it
oh yeah i saw that
we can think of those as we go
oh i see
we could do that here

i think it's config'd right finally
oh oops
i forgot to push lol
ah shit
it's showing up
hmmm
yeah
idk how to hide the whole folder
im remaking the repo lol
looked stupid with all those commits
okay
it's good now
i just removed the config folder

i might remake the bot
i have no idea why it is named quiet bot
okay fellas
he has admin permissions

nice
what kinda features do you guys have in mind can be anything
i imported pylast
discord.py docpylast.py github

guys i'm the best programmer ever
not yet
wanted to do the json thing
can i make it private so that only we can look at it
wow you gotta pay to make repos private
that's trash
prob for gitlab
i'm on github
yall want this on lab or hub
wait
does your repo have the entire ass bible in it
so for the gitignore
can i just do it for json

oh shit

wow i think this might from when i posted the description for stage 3
what a coincidence
/sample
/cample






jake.exe sends random messages every 15 to 30 minutes and the next step is making it able to have a conversation with you



yes
yuperinoi
yeah
yeah
yes
the bot now can have a conversation with you if you  it
try it out
it times out after 10 seconds
you think i'm creepy
that's pretty rude.
oh, i see.
yeah i like death.
bye now.
whoa
lol
needs some tweaking
holy fucking shit
okay i think its good
what did you do to my bot
you only have to  him once
ye
im not at home LOL
you opened like a million threads
stop typing
lol
LOL
its definitely in an infinite loop
i cant stop it till i get home
well
the issue is
i believe when you add a bot its permissions are set
yes
nope
rip
yeah
mhm
nice
i see
okay


this certainly works better
no more infinte loops
you can only have a conversation with it when it post a random messages
not on mention



what

dina drinks
you can also  him

lmao
john are you busy tonight

fucc'
nice
oh yeah idk if i talked about this but
its more bot shit
it just adds my messages to the corpus when it's live
so all this is being added

not yours bitch
i could set it up to logs yours if you wanted
i can get a list of messages for basically anyone with .load
just gotta plug in your ID
you wanna go get a drink or something tonight
maybe michael and brandonc ould come along
maybe
im omw
yeah just me
im at voodoo
looks dope

im probably gonna wander at some point
i dont got a lotta money
im drunk two
drink
i can get literally no one to come downtown
yeah
yes
yes
yeah
agents of titty nice
okay
okay cool
nope
